    <meta name="description" content="Wells Fargo &amp;amp; Company is an American multinational banking and financial services holding company which is headquartered in San Francisco, California, with &quot;hubquarters&quot; throughout the country. It is the fourth largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest bank by market capitalization. Wells Fargo is the second largest bank in deposits, home mortgage servicing, and debit cards. In 2011, Wells Fargo was the 23rd largest company in the United States.
In 2007 it was the only bank in the United States to be rated AAA by S&amp;amp;P, though its rating has since been lowered to AA- in light of the financial crisis of 2007–2012. The firm's primary U.S. operating subsidiary is national bank Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which designates its main office as Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
Wells Fargo in its present form is a result of a merger between San Francisco-based Wells Fargo &amp;amp; Company and Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1998 and the subsequent 2008 acquisition of Charlotte-based Wachovia. Following the mergers, the company transferred its headquarters to Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco and merged its operating subsidiary with Wells Fargo's operating subsidiary in Sioux Falls.
Wells Fargo is one of the &quot;Big Four banks&quot; of the United States, along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup—its main competitors. The company operates across 35 countries and has over 70 million customers globally. In 2012, it had more than 9,000 retail branches and over 12,000 automated teller machines in 39 states and the District of Columbia. As of July 12, 2013, Wells Fargo became the world's biggest bank by market capitalization, worth $236 billion, beating ICBC.
In February 2014 Wells Fargo was named the world's most valuable bank brand for the 2nd year running  in The Banker and Brand Finance study of the top 500 banking brands.

    <meta name="twitter:title" content="Breaking news on Wells Fargo">
    <meta name="twitter:description" content="Wells Fargo &amp;amp; Company is an American multinational banking and financial services holding company which is headquartered in San Francisco, California, with &quot;hubquarters&quot; throughout the country. It is the fourth largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest bank by market capitalization. Wells Fargo is the second largest bank in deposits, home mortgage servicing, and debit cards. In 2011, Wells Fargo was the 23rd largest company in the United States.
In 2007 it was the only bank in the United States to be rated AAA by S&amp;amp;P, though its rating has since been lowered to AA- in light of the financial crisis of 2007–2012. The firm's primary U.S. operating subsidiary is national bank Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which designates its main office as Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
Wells Fargo in its present form is a result of a merger between San Francisco-based Wells Fargo &amp;amp; Company and Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1998 and the subsequent 2008 acquisition of Charlotte-based Wachovia. Following the mergers, the company transferred its headquarters to Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco and merged its operating subsidiary with Wells Fargo's operating subsidiary in Sioux Falls.
Wells Fargo is one of the &quot;Big Four banks&quot; of the United States, along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup—its main competitors. The company operates across 35 countries and has over 70 million customers globally. In 2012, it had more than 9,000 retail branches and over 12,000 automated teller machines in 39 states and the District of Columbia. As of July 12, 2013, Wells Fargo became the world's biggest bank by market capitalization, worth $236 billion, beating ICBC.
In February 2014 Wells Fargo was named the world's most valuable bank brand for the 2nd year running  in The Banker and Brand Finance study of the top 500 banking brands.

      <div class="description padded"><p><b>Wells Fargo &amp; Company</b> is an American multinational banking and financial services holding company which is headquartered in San Francisco, California, with "hubquarters" throughout the country. It is the fourth largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest bank by market capitalization. Wells Fargo is the second largest bank in deposits, home mortgage servicing, and debit cards. In 2011, Wells Fargo was the 23rd largest company in the United States.</p>
<p>In 2007 it was the only bank in the United States to be rated AAA by S&amp;P, though its rating has since been lowered to AA- in light of the financial crisis of 2007–2012. The firm's primary U.S. operating subsidiary is national bank <b>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.</b>, which designates its main office as Sioux Falls, South Dakota.</p>
<p>Wells Fargo in its present form is a result of a merger between San Francisco-based Wells Fargo &amp; Company and Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1998 and the subsequent 2008 acquisition of Charlotte-based Wachovia. Following the mergers, the company transferred its headquarters to Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco and merged its operating subsidiary with Wells Fargo's operating subsidiary in Sioux Falls.</p>
<p>Wells Fargo is one of the "Big Four banks" of the United States, along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup—its main competitors. The company operates across 35 countries and has over 70 million customers globally. In 2012, it had more than 9,000 retail branches and over 12,000 automated teller machines in 39 states and the District of Columbia. As of July 12, 2013, Wells Fargo became the world's biggest bank by market capitalization, worth $236 billion, beating ICBC.</p>
<p>In February 2014 Wells Fargo was named the world's most valuable bank brand for the 2nd year running  in The Banker and Brand Finance study of the top 500 banking brands.</p>

It is the fourth largest bank in the U.S. by assets and the largest bank by market capitalization. Wells Fargo is the second largest bank in deposits, home mortgage servicing, and debit cards. In 2011, Wells Fargo was the 23rd largest company in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>In 2007 it was the only bank in the United States to be rated AAA by S&amp;P, though its rating has since been lowered to AA- in light of the financial crisis of 2007–2012. The firm's primary U.S. operating subsidiary is national bank <b>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.<\/b>, which designates its main office as Sioux Falls, South Dakota.<\/p>\n<p>Wells Fargo in its present form is a result of a merger between San Francisco-based Wells Fargo &amp; Company and Minneapolis-based Norwest Corporation in 1998 and the subsequent 2008 acquisition of Charlotte-based Wachovia. Following the mergers, the company transferred its headquarters to Wells Fargo's headquarters in San Francisco and merged its operating subsidiary with Wells Fargo's operating subsidiary in Sioux Falls.<\/p>\n<p>Wells Fargo is one of the \"Big Four banks\" of the United States, along with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup—its main competitors. The company operates across 35 countries and has over 70 million customers globally. In 2012, it had more than 9,000 retail branches and over 12,000 automated teller machines in 39 states and the District of Columbia. As of July 12, 2013, Wells Fargo became the world's biggest bank by market capitalization, worth $236 billion, beating ICBC.<\/p>\n<p>In February 2014 Wells Fargo was named the world's most valuable bank brand for the 2nd year running  in The Banker and Brand Finance study of the top 500 banking brands.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=731","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wells_Fargo\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latest_item_date":"2014-07-11T12:04:54.713434","muted_by_default":false,"created_on":"2010-10-27T21:43:04","id":731,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wells_Fargo","daily_count":0,"geohash":"","placetype":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=731","category":"Company","twitter_username":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/wells-fargo\/","links":"","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/b3\/Wells_Fargo_Bank.svg","active":true,"woeid":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Lx","name":"Wells Fargo","item_count":56,"latitude":null,"local_url":"\/topic\/wells-fargo\/","slug":"wells-fargo","livevideo":"","kind":"tag","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/731\/"}

The population was estimated to be 1,322,553 as of 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Historically home to the Kumeyaay people, San Diego was the first site visited by Europeans on what is now the West Coast of the United States. Upon landing in San Diego Bay in 1542, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claimed the entire area for Spain, forming the basis for the settlement of Alta California 200 years later. The Presidio and Mission of San Diego, founded in 1769, formed the first European settlement in what is now California. In 1821, San Diego became part of newly independent Mexico, and in 1850, became part of the United States following the Mexican-American War and the admission of California to the union.<\/p>\n<p>The city is the seat of San Diego County and is the economic center of the region as well as the San Diego–Tijuana metropolitan area. San Diego's main economic engines are military and defense-related activities, tourism, international trade, and manufacturing. The presence of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), with the affiliated UCSD Medical Center, has helped make the area a center of research in biotechnology.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1274","longitude":-117.122,"facebookchat":"","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/San_Diego\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latest_item_date":"2014-11-01T09:37:24.990672","muted_by_default":false,"created_on":"2011-05-16T23:40:30","id":1274,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/San_Diego","daily_count":0,"geohash":"9mudjgtnz88b","placetype":"Town","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1274","category":"Town","twitter_username":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/san-diego-ca-us\/","links":"","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/ff\/SD_Montage.jpg","active":true,"woeid":2487889,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Ui","name":"San Diego, CA, US","item_count":608,"latitude":32.8317,"local_url":"\/topic\/san-diego-ca-us\/","slug":"san-diego-ca-us","livevideo":"","kind":"location","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1274\/"},{"recent_count":0,"moderation_status":"approved","description":"<p><b>Bank robbery<\/b> is the crime of stealing from a bank while bank employees, and usually bystanders, are subjected to force, violence or the threat of violence.

A bank links together customers that have capital deficits and customers with capital surpluses.<\/p>\n<p>Due to their importance in the financial system and influence on national economies, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalised a system known as fractional reserve banking, under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.<\/p>\n<p>Banking in its modern sense evolved in the 14th century in the rich cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had its roots in the ancient world. In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties—notably the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs, and the Rothschilds—have played a central role over many centuries.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latest_item_date":"2014-11-04T03:37:11.105430","muted_by_default":false,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","id":1,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","daily_count":60,"geohash":"","placetype":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","category":"Topic","twitter_username":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","links":"","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","active":true,"woeid":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","name":"crime & courts","item_count":45575,"latitude":null,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","slug":"crime-courts","livevideo":"","kind":"vertical","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/"}],"note":null,"type":"tweet","id":440416,"updated_date":"2014-09-20T22:43:48.193861","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/B0je","slug":"breaking-san-diego-police-catch-bank-robber-afte","status":"whitelisted","shortened_url":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/09\/20\/breaking-san-diego-police-catch-bank-robber-afte","tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/10News\/status\/513440947435106304","name":"10News","location":null,"avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000677807766\/affe8694c8369d51202c8e73f6eba3e5_normal.jpeg","id":243811,"screen_name":"10News","content":"#Breaking: San Diego Police catch bank robber after lengthy chase in the Sports Arena area.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latest_item_date":"2014-11-04T03:37:11.105430","muted_by_default":false,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","id":1,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","daily_count":60,"geohash":"","placetype":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","category":"Topic","twitter_username":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","links":"","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","active":true,"woeid":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","name":"crime & courts","item_count":45575,"latitude":null,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","slug":"crime-courts","livevideo":"","kind":"vertical","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/"}],"note":null,"type":"tweet","id":373935,"updated_date":"2014-04-23T21:54:37.091694","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/BjRN","slug":"breaking-gtgt-wells-fargo-offers-reward-in-at","status":"whitelisted","shortened_url":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/04\/23\/breaking-gtgt-wells-fargo-offers-reward-in-at","tweet":{"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KTNV\/status\/459087601631125504","name":"KTNV Action News","location":null,"avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1513116482\/KTNV_TWITTER_ICON_normal.jpg","id":193706,"screen_name":"KTNV","content":"#BREAKING &gt;&gt; Wells Fargo offers reward in attempted bank robbery investigation http:\/\/t.co\/JeXBgICZrI http:\/\/t.co\/kLMw7Rloov","date":"2014-04-23T21:53:08","tweet_id":"459087601631125504","user_id":"16396368","resource_uri":""},"date_ap":"Apr 23, 2014, 09:54 PM GMT","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KTNV\/status\/459087601631125504","submitter":"partner","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/04\/23\/breaking-gtgt-wells-fargo-offers-reward-in-at","content":"#BREAKING &gt;&gt; Wells Fargo offers reward in attempted bank robbery investigation http:\/\/t.co\/JeXBgICZrI http:\/\/t.co\/kLMw7Rloov - @KTNV","source":null,"whoas":0,"date":"2014-04-23T21:54:34.241294","data_type":null,"data":null,"author":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/373935\/"},{"media":null,"pushed":false,"push_content":"","url_domain":"twitter.com","importance":0,"topics":[{"recent_count":0,"moderation_status":"approved","description":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=37095","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","image_credit":"","latest_item_date":"2013-12-22T08:18:33.267195","muted_by_default":false,"created_on":"2013-06-13T21:06:44","id":37095,"wikipedia_url":"","daily_count":0,"geohash":"","placetype":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=37095","category":"Special","twitter_username":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/partner-items\/","links":"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/about\/#about-partners\">Partners<\/a>","image_url":"","active":true,"woeid":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/JoT","name":"Partner items","item_count":341,"latitude":null,"local_url":"\/topic\/partner-items\/","slug":"partner-items","livevideo":"","kind":"tag","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/37095\/"},{"recent_count":0,"moderation_status":"approved","description":"<p><b>Wells Fargo &amp; Company<\/b> is an American multinational banking and financial services holding company which is headquartered in San Francisco, California, with \"hubquarters\" throughout the country.

In the 2000s, an increasing amount of retailing is done using online websites, electronic payment, and then delivered via a courier or via other services.<\/p>\r\n<p>Retailing includes subordinated services, such as delivery. The term \"retailer\" is also applied where a service provider services the needs of a large number of individuals, such as for the public. Shops may be on residential streets, streets with few or no houses or in a shopping mall. Shopping streets may be for pedestrians only.

The loan is \"secured\" on the borrower's property. This means that a legal mechanism is put in place which allows the lender to take possession and sell the secured property (\"foreclosure\" or \"repossession\") to pay off the loan in the event that the borrower defaults on the loan or otherwise fails to abide by its terms. The word <i>mortgage<\/i> is derived from a \"law French\" term used by English lawyers in the middle ages meaning \"death pledge\", and refers to the pledge ending (dying) when either the obligation is fulfilled or the property is taken through foreclosure.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mortgage borrowers can be individuals mortgaging their home or they can be businesses mortgaging commercial property (for example, their own business premises, residential property let to tenants or an investment portfolio). The lender will typically be a financial institution, such as a bank, credit union or building society, depending on the country concerned, and the loan arrangements can be made either directly or indirectly through intermediaries. Features of mortgage loans such as the size of the loan, maturity of the loan, interest rate, method of paying off the loan, and other characteristics can vary considerably. The lender's rights over the secured property take priority over the borrower's other creditors which means that if the borrower becomes bankrupt or insolvent the other creditors will only be repaid the debts owed to them from a sale of the secured property if the mortgage lender is repaid in full first.<\/p>\r\n<p>In many jurisdictions, though not all (Bali, Indonesia being one exception), it is normal for home purchases to be funded by a mortgage loan. Few individuals have enough savings or liquid funds to enable them to purchase property outright.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime.

Out of the league's 32 teams, six (four division winners and two wild-card teams) from each conference compete in the NFL playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, played between the champions of the NFC and AFC. The champions of the Super Bowl are awarded the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Various other awards exist to recognize individual players and coaches.

Citigroup was formed from one of the world's largest mergers in history by combining the banking giant Citicorp and financial conglomerate Travelers Group in October 1998 (announced on April 7, 1998). As of 2008 it was the third largest bank holding company in the US by assets. Its largest shareholders include funds from the Middle East and Singapore. At its height until the global financial crisis of 2008 Citigroup was the largest company and bank in the world by total assets with 357,000 employees. In 2007, Citigroup was one of the primary dealers in US Treasury securities. Citigroup had the world's largest financial services network, spanning 140 countries with approximately 16,000 offices worldwide and holds over 200 million customer accounts in more than 140 countries.<\/p>\n<p>Citigroup suffered huge losses during the global financial crisis of 2008 and was rescued in November 2008 in a massive stimulus package by the U.S. government. On February 27, 2009, Citigroup announced that the US government would take a 36% equity stake in the company by converting US$25 billion in emergency aid into common stock with a US Treasury credit line of $45 billion to prevent the bankruptcy of the largest bank in the world at the time. The government guaranteed losses on more than $300 billion troubled assets and injected $20 billion immediately into the company. In exchange, the salary of the CEO was $1 per year and the highest salary of employees was restricted to $500,000 in cash and any amount above $500,000 had to be paid with restricted stock that could not be sold until the emergency government aid was repaid in full. The US government also gained control of half the seats in the Board of Directors, and the senior management was subjected to removal by the US government if there were poor performance. By December 2009, the US government stake was reduced to 27% majority stake from a 36% majority stake after Citigroup sold $21 billion of common shares and equity in the largest single share sale in US history, surpassing Bank of America's $19 billion share sale one month prior. Eventually by December 2010, Citigroup repaid the emergency aid in full and the US government received an additional $12 billion profit in selling its shares. US Government restrictions on pay and oversight of the senior management were removed after the US government sold its remaining 27% stake as of December 2010.<\/p>\n<p>As of 2009, Citigroup was one of the Big Four banks in the United States, along with Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo.<\/p>\n<p>As of June 2012, year of Citi's 200th anniversary, Citigroup had built up an enormous cash reserve in the wake of the financial crisis with $420 billion in surplus liquid cash and government securities . As of Q1 2012, Citi had tier 1 capital ratio of 12.4%, making one of the best-capitalized financial institutions in the world after billions of dollars in losses from the financial crisis. This was a result of selling more than $500 billion of its special assets placed in Citi Holdings, which were guaranteed from losses by the US Treasury while under federal majority ownership. A special IRS tax exception given to Citi allowed the US Treasury to sell its shares at a profit, while it still owned Citigroup shares, which eventually netted $12 billion. According to Treasury spokeswoman Nayyera Haq, \"This (IRS tax) rule was designed to stop corporate raiders from using loss corporations to evade taxes, and was never intended to address the unprecedented situation where the government owned shares in banks. And it was certainly not written to prevent the government from selling its shares for a profit.\" In 2012, Citigroup ranked 20th in size under the Fortune 500 list. In comparison, JPMorgan Chase, which ranked 16th, was the largest bank in US.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2474","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Citigroup\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latest_item_date":"2014-10-30T20:19:41.196426","muted_by_default":false,"created_on":"2012-02-24T16:50:37","id":2474,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Citigroup","daily_count":0,"geohash":"","placetype":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2474","category":"Company","twitter_username":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/citigroup\/","links":"","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/1b\/Citi.svg","active":true,"woeid":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/n4","name":"Citigroup","item_count":120,"latitude":null,"local_url":"\/topic\/citigroup\/","slug":"citigroup","livevideo":"","kind":"tag","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2474\/"},{"recent_count":0,"moderation_status":"approved","description":"<p>A <b>mortgage loan<\/b>, also referred to as a <b>mortgage<\/b>, is used by purchasers of real property to raise money to buy the property to be purchased or by existing property owners to raise funds for any purpose. The loan is \"secured\" on the borrower's property. This means that a legal mechanism is put in place which allows the lender to take possession and sell the secured property (\"foreclosure\" or \"repossession\") to pay off the loan in the event that the borrower defaults on the loan or otherwise fails to abide by its terms. The word <i>mortgage<\/i> is derived from a \"law French\" term used by English lawyers in the middle ages meaning \"death pledge\", and refers to the pledge ending (dying) when either the obligation is fulfilled or the property is taken through foreclosure.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mortgage borrowers can be individuals mortgaging their home or they can be businesses mortgaging commercial property (for example, their own business premises, residential property let to tenants or an investment portfolio). The lender will typically be a financial institution, such as a bank, credit union or building society, depending on the country concerned, and the loan arrangements can be made either directly or indirectly through intermediaries. Features of mortgage loans such as the size of the loan, maturity of the loan, interest rate, method of paying off the loan, and other characteristics can vary considerably. The lender's rights over the secured property take priority over the borrower's other creditors which means that if the borrower becomes bankrupt or insolvent the other creditors will only be repaid the debts owed to them from a sale of the secured property if the mortgage lender is repaid in full first.<\/p>\r\n<p>In many jurisdictions, though not all (Bali, Indonesia being one exception), it is normal for home purchases to be funded by a mortgage loan. Few individuals have enough savings or liquid funds to enable them to purchase property outright.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world.

While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latest_item_date":"2014-11-04T03:37:11.105430","muted_by_default":false,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","id":1,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","daily_count":60,"geohash":"","placetype":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","category":"Topic","twitter_username":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","links":"","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","active":true,"woeid":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","name":"crime & courts","item_count":45575,"latitude":null,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","slug":"crime-courts","livevideo":"","kind":"vertical","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/"}],"note":null,"type":"text","id":306878,"updated_date":"2013-11-22T20:34:12.990529","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/BRzo","slug":"us-seeks-permission-to-add-wells-fargo-executive-a","status":"published","shortened_url":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2013\/11\/22\/us-seeks-permission-to-add-wells-fargo-executive-a","tweet":null,"date_ap":"Nov 22, 2013, 08:34 PM GMT","url":"","submitter":"editor","local_url":"\/item\/2013\/11\/22\/us-seeks-permission-to-add-wells-fargo-executive-a","content":"US seeks permission to add Wells Fargo executive as a defendant in its lawsuit accusing the bank of fraud - @Reuters","source":null,"whoas":7,"date":"2013-11-22T20:34:08.036145","data_type":null,"data":null,"author":{"last_name":"Johnson","email":"grace.johnson@breakingnews.com","id":11,"first_name":"Grace","is_staff":true,"username":"grace.johnson","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/11\/"},"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/306878\/"},{"media":null,"pushed":true,"push_content":"Wells Fargo posts earnings of 99 cents a share vs. 97 cents estimate - @CNBC","url_domain":"cnbc.com","importance":3,"topics":[{"recent_count":0,"moderation_status":"approved","description":"<p>A <b>bank<\/b> is a financial intermediary that accepts deposits and channels those deposits into lending activities, either directly by loaning or indirectly through capital markets.

Along with other GSEs, Freddie Mac buys mortgages on the secondary market, pools them, and sells them as a mortgage-backed security to investors on the open market. This secondary mortgage market increases the supply of money available for mortgage lending and increases the money available for new home purchases. The name, \"Freddie Mac\", is a variant of the initialism of the company's full name that had been adopted officially for ease of identification (see \"GSEs\" below for other examples).<\/p>\n<p>On September 7, 2008, Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) director James B. Lockhart III announced he had put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of the FHFA (see Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). The action has been described as \"one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades\".<\/p>\n<p>Moody's gave Freddie Mac's preferred stock an investment grade rating of A1 until August 22, 2008, when Warren Buffett said publicly that both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae had tried to attract him and others. Moody's changed the credit rating on that day to Baa3, the lowest investment grade credit rating.

The loan is \"secured\" on the borrower's property. This means that a legal mechanism is put in place which allows the lender to take possession and sell the secured property (\"foreclosure\" or \"repossession\") to pay off the loan in the event that the borrower defaults on the loan or otherwise fails to abide by its terms. The word <i>mortgage<\/i> is derived from a \"law French\" term used by English lawyers in the middle ages meaning \"death pledge\", and refers to the pledge ending (dying) when either the obligation is fulfilled or the property is taken through foreclosure.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mortgage borrowers can be individuals mortgaging their home or they can be businesses mortgaging commercial property (for example, their own business premises, residential property let to tenants or an investment portfolio). The lender will typically be a financial institution, such as a bank, credit union or building society, depending on the country concerned, and the loan arrangements can be made either directly or indirectly through intermediaries. Features of mortgage loans such as the size of the loan, maturity of the loan, interest rate, method of paying off the loan, and other characteristics can vary considerably. The lender's rights over the secured property take priority over the borrower's other creditors which means that if the borrower becomes bankrupt or insolvent the other creditors will only be repaid the debts owed to them from a sale of the secured property if the mortgage lender is repaid in full first.<\/p>\r\n<p>In many jurisdictions, though not all (Bali, Indonesia being one exception), it is normal for home purchases to be funded by a mortgage loan.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","longitude":-95.845,"facebookchat":"","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latest_item_date":"2014-11-04T00:20:58.274047","muted_by_default":false,"created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","id":10,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","daily_count":11,"geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","placetype":"Country","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","category":"Country","twitter_username":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","links":"","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg","active":true,"woeid":23424977,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","name":"United States","item_count":14548,"latitude":37.1679,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/","slug":"united-states","livevideo":"","kind":"location","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/"},{"recent_count":0,"moderation_status":"approved","description":"<p>A <b>mortgage loan<\/b>, also referred to as a <b>mortgage<\/b>, is used by purchasers of real property to raise money to buy the property to be purchased or by existing property owners to raise funds for any purpose.

The loan is \"secured\" on the borrower's property. This means that a legal mechanism is put in place which allows the lender to take possession and sell the secured property (\"foreclosure\" or \"repossession\") to pay off the loan in the event that the borrower defaults on the loan or otherwise fails to abide by its terms. The word <i>mortgage<\/i> is derived from a \"law French\" term used by English lawyers in the middle ages meaning \"death pledge\", and refers to the pledge ending (dying) when either the obligation is fulfilled or the property is taken through foreclosure.<\/p>\r\n<p>Mortgage borrowers can be individuals mortgaging their home or they can be businesses mortgaging commercial property (for example, their own business premises, residential property let to tenants or an investment portfolio). The lender will typically be a financial institution, such as a bank, credit union or building society, depending on the country concerned, and the loan arrangements can be made either directly or indirectly through intermediaries. Features of mortgage loans such as the size of the loan, maturity of the loan, interest rate, method of paying off the loan, and other characteristics can vary considerably. The lender's rights over the secured property take priority over the borrower's other creditors which means that if the borrower becomes bankrupt or insolvent the other creditors will only be repaid the debts owed to them from a sale of the secured property if the mortgage lender is repaid in full first.<\/p>\r\n<p>In many jurisdictions, though not all (Bali, Indonesia being one exception), it is normal for home purchases to be funded by a mortgage loan. Few individuals have enough savings or liquid funds to enable them to purchase property outright. In countries where the demand for home ownership is highest, strong domestic markets for mortgages have developed.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1097","longitude":null,"facebookchat":"","image_credit":"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mortgage_loan\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latest_item_date":"2014-10-08T11:11:24.775841","muted_by_default":false,"created_on":"2011-04-13T17:55:17","id":1097,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mortgage_loan","daily_count":0,"geohash":"","placetype":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1097","category":"IndustryTerm","twitter_username":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/mortgages\/","links":"","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/c\/ca\/BilleteiNTER_II.jpg","active":false,"woeid":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Rr","name":"mortgages","item_count":365,"latitude":null,"local_url":"\/topic\/mortgages\/","slug":"mortgages","livevideo":"","kind":"tag","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1097\/"},{"recent_count":0,"moderation_status":"approved","description":"<p><b>Wells Fargo &amp; Company<\/b> is an American multinational banking and financial services holding company which is headquartered in San Francisco, California, with \"hubquarters\" throughout the country.
