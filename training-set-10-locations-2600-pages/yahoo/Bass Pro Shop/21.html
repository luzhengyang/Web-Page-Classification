			        <p>The annual Greater Cincinnati Amateur Radio Association Cincinnati Hamfest and Communications Expo began in 1937. Possibly the oldest hamfest in the world, this has become the main amateur radio/communications event of the summer in our region. These Hamfests are unique because of the combination of the family-like setting they provide for the technical aspect of the shows. These Hamfests are considered by many to be the most enjoyable shows they attend.</p>

                        <strong>WHERE AND WHEN IS THE HUNT?</strong> The Hidden transmitter hunt at Cincinnati Hamfest will begin at approximately 11:00 AM Sunday. At 10:45 AM we will start with last minute directions and transmitter cards provided at the GCARA Headquarters booth. At that time you will be given any instructions concerning the transmitters, their frequencies, special restrictions on frequencies for beginners and additional information. The entire Hidden Transmitter Hunt site is contained on the grounds of the Diamond Oaks Campus (indoors and outdoors).</p>
			        <p><strong>WHEN CAN I REGISTER FOR THE HUNT?</strong> Sign in at the GCARA Booth prior to the start of the Hidden Transmitter Hunt. There will be several transmitters that will be exclusively for the Beginner Hunters so that they have a chance to improve their skills and develop confidence in searching for the transmitters. Frequencies for Beginner or Experienced categories will be provided before the start of the hunt.</p>
			        <p><strong>WHAT RADIO DIRECTION FINDING GEAR DO I NEED?</strong> Anything that you can carry is acceptable, so long as it does not radiate strong RF interference (i.e., no regenerative receivers). Some hunters use only an HT with simple body shielding and a foil tube attenuator. Others use more sophisticated gear like yagis, quads, SuperDFs and other equipment.</p>
			        <p><strong>Our Hidden Transmitter Hunt is Different!</strong><br>
			          · The hunt will be entirely on foot<br>
			          · There will be approximately 10-12 Transmitters on 2 meters<br>
			          · Two Experience classes provided for the hunts to be fair to all<br>
			          · Prizes for finding the Hidden Transmitters<br>
			          · No Ham license Required for Receiving and Tracking<br>
			          · Contestants must registered before the start of the contest<br>
			          · There will be indoor and outdoor venues<br>
			          · Assemble before 10:45 AM at GCARA Booth</p>
			        <p align="center" class="style15">IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE HIDDEN TRANSMITTER HUNT</p>
			        <p>The Starting Point will be the GCARA Headquarters Booth. Arrive at the site about 10:45 AM to receive all pre-hunt instructions. If you are late and have not registered you may not be allowed to hunt.</p>
			        <p>This is an on-foot hunt. You may not use any wheeled conveyances (bicycles, skateboards, etc.) Exceptions and accommodations will be made for persons with physical disabilities, but arrangements must be made in advance.</p>
			        <p>Two-Meter signals will be transmitted. You will be provided with a listing of the frequencies prior to the start of the Hunt.</p>
			        <p>When you find a Hidden Transmitter, please do not touch it. Copy the two-number or letter code on the label of the transmitter onto a piece of paper. Take the paper with the transmitter code to the GCARA booth in the main hall to claim your prize. At this time, the transmitter will be deactivated, logged in as being found and an announcement made that its frequency is not longer being transmitted. Failure to leave the transmitter in its place may result in disqualification.</p>
			        <p>Bring your own: RDF gear, spare batteries, compass, and any additional equipment that you think will be necessary. A sheet of rules and the transmitter frequencies will be provided to you at the time of registration for the Hunt.</p>
			        <p>If you think that a person is carrying the transmitter, you must be declarative! You must tell the individual that he/she has the transmitter. You are not allowed to ask the person if he or she has it!</p>
			        <p>The Hidden Transmitter Committee will determine the duration of the race. Decisions of the Committee will be final.</p>
