<br>
I wish it was here in Northern Kentucky, but this is a good thing for everyone in the surrounding Tristate area of Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. <br>
<br>
 Basically according to documents filed with the planning commission, Cabela's plans to build and open a store in West Chester Ohio just slightly North of Cincinnati. Right now, the closest store is in Louisville roughly 100 miles away depending where you are in the Tristate. <br>

<br>
Rumor control has it that before the Columbus store was built they were going to build a store up this way in the Macedonia and Northfield area as part of a sports complex. Then one of the involved communities backed out and Cabela's said thanks but no thanks. <br>
<br>
When I do large orders of heavy items I have them shipped to the Polaris store and coordinate kids and grand kids visits around my orders. Heck, we may head down this weekend so I'll take some time and visit the Polaris store. Never know what I might find. Then too, there's always those little peanut squares I like.  :)<br>

(Cabela's Incorporated) -- Cabela's Incorporated (NYSE:CAB), the World's Foremost Outfitter(r) of hunting, fishing and outdoor gear, announced today plans to open an 82,000-square-foot store in West Chester, Ohio, serving the greater Cincinnati area."<br>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cee Zee</div><div class="date">August 29, 2014, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now, the closest store is in Louisville roughly 100 miles away depending where you are in the Tristate. <br>
<br>
I live out to the east a few miles which makes the Polaris store far closer than the Louisville store.  The one they're building will still be over 60 miles from where I live.  And for other people in the tri-state it could be a lot farther.  <br>
<br>
To be honest I'm not all that crazy about the Cabela's stores I've been in.  They don't have good prices on things IMO.  And they don't have that great of a selection for guns.  I suppose if I wanted to dress like the Duck Dynasty crowd it might be a good place to buy clothes.  But there's already a Bass Pro shop in the area where they're building the new Cabelas and I don't see a lot of difference between them actually.  <br>
<br>
I don't think so many big box stores can be supported once the gun salesman in chief leaves office.  Gun sales will likely go back to a more normal rate and that means it will be hard to keep so many shops open.  There are other fairly big gun shops in that area too including Target World (which isn't that great IMO but it's pretty big). I think Vances in Columbus has those shops beat and I think that several gun shops near where I did live are better places to buy guns.  I've gotten far better deals there.  I do like the collection of really expensive guns at the Cabelas at Polaris.  I can't afford them of course but maybe I'll find one I could buy some day.  I have seen Sako rifles at Cabelas too which is something I haven't seen at other shops but I haven't really been to that Bass Pro shop near Forest Park.  I've been to other Bass Pro shops though including one in Charlotte that was amazing.  I guess it's actually an outlet too or they called it that when I was there more than a few years ago.</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reloadron</div><div class="date">August 29, 2014, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Should be checking out the Columbus store this weekend. Have family and a brand new grandson down in Columbus and we are heading down for the weekend. Last trip I couldn't find anything that tripped my trigger in the gun library. That seldom happens.

Cabelas is not only all that but they have good food there.  My wife wants to go and mentions Cabelas as she gets lunch there!<br>
<br>
I find the clerks there just fine and normal.  You get back from folks what you present yourself.<br>

I see guns there in the Gun Library that other shops never have.<br>

<br>
Saw a pretty sweet S&amp;W Model 17 (no dash). Looked at the gun a few times and finally asked if there was any room on the $799 asking price. The guy checked the computer and told me if I was serious they would drop to $700 and that was as good as it gets. I bought it. <br>
