        at 4441 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach, Florida was designed by <a href="http://www.miamibeach411.com/History/bio_lapidus.html" target="_blank"> Morris Lapidus</a> for Ben
        Novak, the owner, and opened in 1954. Once the Fontainebleau opened the 
        in-crowd nightspots gradually moved up to the ocean-front hotels along 
        Collins Avenue from about 30th Street up thru 65th Street, and from 1954

        <p align="left">Enjoying a reputation as the area's top resort hotel, it was a favorite stopover for notables such as Frank
        Sinatra, Bob Hope, Sammy Davis, Jr., Lucille Ball, Jackie Gleason, Judy Garland, Milton Berle, Jerry Lewis, Marlene Dietrich, Debbie Reynolds
        among many others and every president since Dwight D. Eisenhower. The resort's famed crescent shape is set amid 20 lush tropical acres and accented by a magnificent grotto-style pool with cascading waterfalls. Its classic guest rooms afford spectacular water views and some are equipped with private
        terraces.<sup><font size="1">1</font></sup></p>

        <p align="left">The Hotel has been the setting of films like "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053644/" target="_blank">The Bellboy</a>,"
        starring Jerry Lewis, "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058150/" target="_blank">Goldfinger</a>," starring Sean
        Connery as James Bond and "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/" target="_blank">Scarface</a>" that featured Al Pacino
        as gangster Tony Montoya. Whitney Houston sang Dolly Parton's "<i>I Will 
        Always Love You</i>" from the Grand Ballroom in the 1992 movie "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103855/">The 
        Bodyguard</a>."&nbsp; The Grand Ballroom was the biggest in Miami with
        a stage and capacity of 2200 people.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960 the series of
        four bi-monthly Frank Sinatra specials sponsored by Timex were taped from
        the stage of the Grand Ballroom and aired on ABC television.&nbsp; The
        series though, is most remembered for one episode which was Frank's
        "<a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290620/">Welcome Home, 
        Elvis</a>" party  taped only weeks after Elvis'
        return from the Army in March of 1960.

        <p align="left">Frank was no fan of rock 'n' roll music and had had a few choice words to say about it in the past. 
        In an oft-quoted remark to a Paris magazine in 1957, Frank Sinatra 
        declared, "<i>Rock 'n' roll smells phony and false. It is sung, played 
        and written for the most part by cretinous goons and by means of its 
        almost imbecilic reiteration, and sly, lewd, in plain fact, dirty 
        lyrics...it manages to be the martial music of every sideburned 
        delinquent on the face of the earth.</i>" But whatever the reason - ratings ploy or simply to placate his teenage daughter - Sinatra was feeling gracious enough to invite Presley to join him on his show.<sup><font size="1">2</font></sup>&nbsp; 
        In fact he had sent his daughter Nancy to greet Elvis upon his arrival 
        from Germany at <span id="mainImageInfoControl1_lblImageCaption">McGuire 
        Air Force base in New Jersey </span>with a box of custom tailored shirts.</p>

        <p align="left">Just weeks after Elvis' discharge, Scotty and DJ 
        reunited with Elvis again and proceeded to Nashville for their first 
        session at Studio B.&nbsp; Bill Black chose not to return. After recording two ballads, "<i>Stuck on you</i>" and "<i>Fame 
        and Fortune</i>," Elvis and the band boarded a train in Nashville and headed 
        south to Miami on March 21st. Scotty remembers seeing people lining the 
        tracks along the way. The trip was supposed to be secret, but Colonel Parker, in 
        an effort to get publicity, called every small town along the way. At 
        some stops Parker got Elvis to stand on the back platform, like he had 
        seen some presidents do, and wave to the cheering crowds.<sup><font size="1">3</font></sup>

        Miami on the 22nd, they checked in to the Hotel Fontainebleau.&nbsp; For 
        the rest of the week they rehearsed for the show. Asked if he has changed 
        his mind and set aside his very pronounced views about rock 'n' roll (<i>a 
        music "for cretinous goons"</i>), Sinatra side stepped the question, 
        responding, "<i>The kid's been away two years, and I get the feeling he 
        really believes in what he's doing.</i>" The television show was taped 
        at 6:15 p.m. in the Grand Ballroom on March 26, 1960 but it wasn't
        broadcast until May 12th, almost six weeks later.&nbsp; Elvis performed the two new songs recorded in 
        Nashville and duets with Frank in a mutual reversal of roles, on both 
        the host's "<i>Witchcraft</i>" and his own "<i>Love Me Tender</i>."<sup><font size="1">4</font></sup></p><p align="center">

        <p align="left">Concerned about mounting expenses, Colonel Parker hired 
        a bus to carry the group back to Memphis. It was the only 
        appearance/performance the band would make that year but Scotty and DJ 
        would soon after make their final appearance in an Elvis film in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053848/">
        GI Blues</a>, which coincidentally featured Sinatra's current 
        girlfriend, Juliet Prowse.&nbsp; Over the years other more modern hotels 
        and properties were built, and restored boutique hotels entered the 
        market as the Fontainebleau gradually lost its luster and many changes to the property occurred.</p>

        with the hotel's name, even furnishings for a suite known as the "Goldfinger

        fast, with some costing as little as 25 cents.<sup><font size="1">5</font></sup></p><p align="center">

        <p class="inside-copy">The grand lobby's original white-and-black 
        bow-tie floor pattern was recreated out of new materials, and its 
        furrowed columns were preserved and refurbished. So too was the 
        Fontainebleau's famed "Staircase to Nowhere," which historically led to 
        a small coat room just above the lobby. Belles and beaus would take an 
        elevator up, check their coats and descend the stairs for a grand 
        entrance. The coat check is gone — not a terribly sensible feature in 
        the tropics, anyway — but the runway remains.<sup><font size="1">6</font></sup></p>

        and the <a href="http://sinatrafamily.com/forum/index.php" target="_blank">Sinatra
        Family Forum</a> we were able to connect with Stan Musick who was the
        Fender bass player that performed with Elvis, Scotty, and D.J. for the
        Sinatra show at the Fontainebleau along with Anselmo Sacasas on piano
        and an, as yet, unnamed upright bass player.&nbsp; In May of 2009 he had
        this to say about it, "<i>Joe Comfort was the bass player with Nelson Riddle,
        I loaned him my upright bass for the session, but the photos shown were from the band that Scotty Moore hired for the session. I'm sorry to say that I don't remember the name of the upright bass player next to me in the photo.
        As I recall [and it's a long time ago], nobody on the band seemed to be familiar with the other musicians.&nbsp;</i></p><p align="left"><i> Elvis stayed at a penthouse in the
        Fontainebleau Hotel and since I was a new addition he asked me to come up and say
        hello and to discuss his music. I spent an hour or so with him and he turned out to be a gentleman and a really likable young man. Since he just got out of the service, he had a tendency to call every male, "sir" and I reminded him that he was no longer in the service and he laughed really hard.
        I had a wonderful time with him. When I told him that I played bass on a USO Tour in Germany and that we appeared at his Army Base where he was stationed, he actually remembered the show.</i></p><p align="left"><i>As a local musician, I played bass on many different occasions in the
        Fontainebleau Hotel. I remember playing in the La Ronde room with a large orchestra for Eddie Fischer when he was on top of his career. Also, I remember playing [at the
        Fontainebleau] with an orchestra from New York [can't remember the name] as a tribute to Eleanor Roosevelt [she was still alive at that time]. This is where I met Joe Comfort, the bass player with Nelson Riddle's orchestra. I believe it was the night before the Timex show and he came up to me and remarked how he liked the way my upright bass sounded. He then proceeded to tell me that he wasn't allowed to bring his upright bass [from California] and he had rented a plywood upright bass from Ace Music here in Miami. He wasn't happy with the plywood bass so I said he could use my upright bass for the Timex Show. That's how we became friends.&nbsp;</i></p><p align="left"><i> In 1972 I was musical director at the Playboy Plaza Hotel in Miami Beach and I remember having 32 musicians for Tony Bennett and my orchestra also played for Liza Minelli, Sammy Davis, Diahann Carroll, Mitzi Gaynor and others. I'm now 80 years old and am lucky enough to still be healthy.</i></p><p align="left">added
        May 11, 2009</p><p align="left"><font size="2">just to add, Scotty has said
        he did not hire anyone or know anyone there. He just spoke to them
        briefly during rehearsal and the show. It's likely that additional band
        members were the responsibility of and arranged through the Colonel, Tom
        Diskin or their contacts. He added that Elvis did not call him “sir”
        because of being in the service. He called everyone m’am and sir
        because his mother taught him that when he was very young and he
        continued to do so all the years Scotty knew him.</font></p><p align="left"></p><hr><p align="left">

        </font>The landmark Miami Beach hotel, the Fontainebleau, once 
        synonymous with panache and frequented by Frank Sinatra, Elvis and 
        Marilyn Monroe, has reopened after an extensive renovation and again 
        welcomed celebrities. <br>
        <br>
        Paris Hilton, Gwyneth Paltrow and Kate Hudson attended a recent 
        reopening party at the resort. </p><p align="left">
        “It’s a different glamour today, but it still has the intensity and 
        freshness of the 1950s with a 2008 look,” says Donald F. Wolfe, a 
        partner with Nichols Brosch Wurst Wolfe &amp; Associates of Miami, the 
        designer of the $1 billion renovation and expansion project for 
        Fontainebleau Resorts of Miami Beach and Nakheel Hotels &amp; Resorts of the 
        United Arab Emirates. The owners did not respond to requests for 
        information about the project.<br>
        <br>
        “The goal was to update and preserve an iconic piece of architecture on 
        Miami Beach,” says Rick Lee, senior vice president of HKS, the architect 
        of record. “The owners wanted an up-to-date piece of architecture that 
        would revitalize the property and at the same time respect its 
        historical significance. That was a challenge.”<br>
        <br>
        City of Miami Beach officials have praised the result. <br>
        <br>
        “We’re glad to see it reopen,” says William Cary, who is the assistant 
        planning director for the city and was significantly involved with the 
        project’s design and final construction. “It has quite a sensational 
        impact when you walk into the space.”<br>
        <br>
        Senior city planner Debbie Tackett, calls it spectacular.<br>
        <br>
        “The new and old work well together,” she says. <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        The Morris Lapidus-designed, crescent-shaped, Miami Modern-style hotel 
        opened in 1954. It ushered in an era of pizzazz as celebrities and those 
        who wanted to rub shoulders or say they stayed at the same hotel flocked 
        to the oceanfront resort. <br>
        <br>
        “[Lapidus’s] purpose in life was to create a sense of delight for the 
        users of his architecture,” Cary says. <br>
        <br>
        The Fontainebleau gradually lost its luster as other, more modern 
        lodging properties and restored boutique hotels entered the market. Over 
        the years, many changes to the property occurred. The Versailles hotel 
        tower and ballroom, designed by A. Herbert Mathes, was started about 
        three years after the curved Chateau building opened, and the Versailles 
        connected to the Lapidus structure, altering its original appearance.
        <br>
        <br>
        “When the Fontainebleau opened, the critics were not kind, and [Lapidus] 
        was disturbed by the critiques,” Cary says. That led Lapidus to destroy 
        almost all of the original drawings, plans and renderings. <br>
        <br>
        The city had access to a poor photocopy of some plans. The team and city 
        relied on old black-and-white photographs, speaking with people and 
        examining the original fabric to determine how the property looked soon 
        after it opened. For instance, pulling up carpeting allowed the team to 
        trace out original walls and reception desks.<br>
        <br>
        “When you put all of these things together, you get back closer to what 
        was originally there, but I would refrain from calling it a detailed 
        restoration,” Cary says. “In order to restore, you would have had to 
        remove those later connections to the lobby. <br>
        <br>
        “Basically, it was a matter of restoring elements that were in areas 
        where they could be re-created and reinterpreting them in a more modern 
        sense. Morris Lapidus always said, ‘I create my architecture for the 
        people of my time.’ We felt it was truest to his vision to redefine his 
        architecture.”<br>
        <br>
        Cary says Lapidus felt preservation should be left to the people using 
        the buildings. <br>
        <br>
        The city’s historic preservation staff deemed several components of the 
        original hotel as significant, including the stairway to nowhere and 
        columns in the lobby. Some of the original tiles on those columns could 
        not be repaired, so the team re-created the effect with new materials.<br>
        <br>
        Most of Lapidus’ bowtie floor had been destroyed after hotelier Stephen 
        Muss bought the property out of bankruptcy during the 1970s and put in 
        escalators to a commercial floor below. The current renovators used a 
        computer-generated plan to replicate the floor and install new tiles.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Where we could, we tried to maintain the original, and where could not, 
        we replicated it as best we could,” HKS’ Lee says. <br>
        <br>
        State building codes required some modifications. Cary says that codes 
        prevent any stairway to have openings between rails of more than 4-in. 
        The marble-treaded “stairway to nowhere” had an open metal railing 
        system with a hardwood rail.<br>
        <br>
        “It was impossible to retain that the way it was,”’ Cary says. “We had 
        to allow a system to be designed which installed vertical glass plates 
        along the steps.” <br>
        <br>
        Interior designer Jeffrey Beers International of New York returned the 
        reception desk area to its original location. However, this time instead 
        of wood, the panels behind it feature blue-grey mirror glass with a 
        polished nickel frame offset from the wall. <br>
        <br>
        In the sunken garden lobby, about three steps down from the main lobby 
        and overlooking the ocean, the historic preservation board approved the 
        introduction of an illuminated blue glass floor with fiber-optic 
        lighting beneath it and an elegant polished-nickel and glass chandelier.
        <br>
        <br>
        “It creates a dramatic effect,” Cary says. “Lapidus was about effect.”<br>
        <br>
        In certain areas, the team expanded the property and replicated certain 
        architectural elements, such as a waved-formed canopy above the doors 
        from the lobby to the pool area, which had been altered more than two 
        decades ago. <br>
        <br>
        The team created a three-dimensional survey of the main and secondary 
        ballrooms, the lobby and the nightclub areas using laser scanners to 
        identify existing components. HKS imported that into its CAD system. <br>
        <br>
        “Without that information, we would be guessing where specific walls 
        were, unless we went out there and pulled a tape measure,” Lee says. 
        “Even if we were to do that, we would not come up with an accurate CAD 
        depiction of the space.”<br>
        <br>
        The current design team, including structural engineer Walter P. Moore 
        and Associates of Austin, Texas, contacted the original structural 
        engineer, Jacques L. Clarke of the former Oboler &amp; Clarke of North Miami 
        Beach, to learn how he designed lateral bracing for the concrete-frame 
        and block Chateau building. <br>
        <br>
        “By today’s standards, some of the things he did were innovative,” Lee 
        says. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b><font color="#800000">The guest rooms</font></b><br>
        <br>
        Crews gutted the upper floors and re-created 846 guest rooms and suites 
        in the original two buildings—the Chateau and Versailles. <br>
        <br>
        “I don’t know that many people want to relive the 1950s style,” Lee 
        says. “They were updated to current thinking.”<br>
        <br>
        Fontainebleau Resorts added 658 junior suites in two new all-suite 
        towers, also designed by Nichols Brosch Wurst Wolfe &amp; Associates. City 
        officials reviewed all of the designs. <br>
        <br>
        “The opening event and seeing the spaces being used again in a way they 
        were originally intended to be used would have been a great thrill for 
        Lapidus,” Cary says. “There is no other venue like it, not only in Miami 
        Beach but, possibly, in South Florida. It redefines glamour.”
