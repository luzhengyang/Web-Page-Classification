      1-800-GOT-JUNK? LLC bills itself as "North America's largest
      junk removal service" with more than 150 franchised locations in
      the United States and Canada. The firm's blue, green, and white
      trucks pick up items that are too big for curbside garbage collection, but
      not large enough to merit a heavy-duty waste hauling service. Fees are
      based on the volume of truck space filled, with a typical job running
      about $290. The firm's clientele includes homeowners, property
      management companies, construction firms, and corporations. The company is
      owned by founder and CEO <a href="/knowledge/1_800_GOT_JUNK_.html" title="View 'brian scudamore' definition from Wikipedia" class="knldlink" rel="nofollow">Brian Scudamore</a>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="article_container">
    <h2>
      Beginnings
    </h2>
    <p>
      The company known as 1-800-GOT-JUNK? was founded as The Rubbish Boys in
      1989 by Brian Scudamore in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Born in
      San Francisco, Scudamore had moved with his parents to Vancouver at eight
      and had shown an entrepreneurial spirit from a young age, delivering
      papers at nine, washing cars for money at 11, and selling candy and snacks
      to his classmates at 14.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scudamore's studies sometimes took a back seat to his side
      activities, and he dropped out of high school one class shy of graduation,
      though he managed to secure admission to a community college for the fall
      of 1989. He began to look for summer work to pay for his tuition, but the
      job market was tight, and he could not find employment. One day, while
      sitting in the <a href="/knowledge/Drive_through.html" title="View 'drive-through' definition from Wikipedia" class="knldlink" rel="nofollow">drive-through</a> lane of a local McDonald's, the
      19-year-old found himself staring idly at a truck full of junk in front of
      him. For Scudamore, it was a "Eureka" momentâ€”he
      decided then and there to begin hauling trash.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he withdrew $700 from the bank to buy an old Ford pickup
      truck, and made preparations to get business cards and flyers printed.
      Seeking to give his one-man junk-hauling operation the illusion of size,
      he dubbed it The Rubbish Boys, adding the slogan, "We'll
      Stash Your Trash in a Flash!" He painted his new business phone
      number, 738-JUNK, on the <a href="/knowledge/Plywood.html" title="View 'plywood' definition from Wikipedia" class="knldlink" rel="nofollow">plywood</a> sides he had attached to the back of the
      truck, and waited for the phone to ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Work soon began trickling in, and by summer's end Scudamore had
      made a profit of $1,700. After his first year in college he revived the
      trash hauling business for another summer, but in the fall he began taking
      business management classes at the distant University of Montreal. He
      decided to transfer to the University of British Columbia in Vancouver
      after a year, however, so he could run his trash hauling business
      year-round.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1993, with the successful business demanding more and more of his
      attention, Scudamore decided to quit school to pick up junk full time.
      Although his surgeon father was appalled, in the newly incorporated
      firm's first year of full-time operation, revenues hit $100,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1994 Scudamore opened a small office in Vancouver to serve as a
      dispatch center for the three trucks he now owned, and the following year
      he began developing custom computer software to use for scheduling,
      marketing, and accounting. In 1995 a branch operation was launched in
      Victoria, British Columbia, with a partner, and in 1996 The Rubbish Boys
      recorded $1 million in revenues for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year 1997 saw the company hire Paul Guy, who had been the general
      manager of College Pro Painters in British Columbia, to help develop a
      franchise plan. That same year, the firm's first American location
      was set up in Seattle, Washington.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="article_container">
    <h2>
      Name Change to 1-800-GOT-JUNK? in 1998
    </h2>
    <p>
      In 1998 Scudamore made the decision to change both the company's
      name and its phone number to 1-800-GOT-JUNK to
       provide more marketing punch. The number already belonged to a state
      agency in Idaho, and it took him several weeks to convince the official in
      charge to give it up. The company subsequently painted the number in large
      type on the sides of its trucks, enabling them to double as mobile
      billboards. 1-800-GOT-JUNK? staff also had begun using several
      "guerrilla marketing" tactics to promote the firm, including
      putting signs on telephone poles, placing company flyers on
      homeowners' doorknobs between deliveries, and parking trucks near
      stores like Home Depot where potential clients might lurk. Later, the
      firm's employees would don blue wigs and stand at intersections to
      wave signs advertising the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scudamore's years of experience as a junk hauler had given him
      ample time to hone his own approach to the business. Declaring his goal to
      be "the Federal Express of junk removal," he focused on
      earning a reputation for service, reliability, and professionalism,
      projecting expansion to a total of 30 locations by 2003. He was the sole
      owner of the firm, having shed an early partner, and its growth had been
      financed entirely through internally generated funds or loans that had
      been quickly repaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1999 consultant Paul Guy quit to open a location of his own in Toronto,
      Ontario, kicking off the firm's new franchise program. The
      franchise fee was $20,000 plus a royalty of 8 percent of revenues, as well
      as 7 percent to fund the call center and 1 percent for national
      advertising. With truck and office rental and other initial expenses, the
      total start-up cost was in the neighborhood of $50,000. Many new
      franchises were started by people who had grown tired of their careers in
      the corporate world. The entry costs were relatively low, and after
      several years of hauling junk themselves while the business grew, they
      could hire college students or other young workers to do the bulk of the
      manual labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company's Vancouver headquarters handled all incoming orders
      and scheduling of pickups, which helped standardize customer service
      systemwide, and also allowed individual operators to focus on doing field
      work, rather than dwelling on administrative tasks. Orders could be placed
      via the call center or the company's web site, and a completed
      order would be routed to the local franchise via the Internet and
      scheduled in a two-hour window. The franchisee called customers to confirm
      arrival time about a half hour ahead, and then made a follow-up call
      afterward to verify that they were satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The firm's typical pickup fee was $300 for a 15-cubic-yard load,
      which included two hours of labor. Additional labor was $22 per hour. Jobs
      were typically scheduled a day or two in advance, but same-day service was
      also available. A franchisee might expect to do as many as eight or more
      pickups in a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company's staff wore uniforms and presented clients with a
      printed price listâ€”a stark contrast to the stereotypically shabby
      appearance of the small-time trash hauler, whose fee might vary depending
      on the perceived size of a customer's wallet. The firm required
      that each truck be washed daily, and if they were not maintained well, the
      company could cancel the franchise.
    </p>
    <p>
      1-800-GOT-JUNK? did not accept hazardous materials such as paint or
      chemicals, and attempted to recycle most of what was picked up. Drivers
      got first <a href="/knowledge/Dibs.html" title="View 'dibs' definition from Wikipedia" class="knldlink" rel="nofollow">dibs</a> on usable items, though most were taken to charitable
      organizations like <a href="/knowledge/Goodwill_Industries.html" title="View 'goodwill industries' definition from Wikipedia" class="knldlink" rel="nofollow">Goodwill Industries</a>. The firm's fees included
      the cost of dropoff at a local dump, which gave its employees an incentive
      to recycle, as it was usually free or even sometimes generated a small
      amount of revenue. As much as 60 percent of what was picked up was
      recycled. Approximately three-fourths of the firm's business took
      place between April and October, when moving or home renovation projects
      brought much work.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of 1-800-GOT-JUNK?'s operations utilized the firm's own
      JunkNet software, an Internet-based application that each franchisee used
      to get daily scheduling information as well as to perform management,
      payroll, and accounting tasks. The software also could send text messages
      to drivers' cellular telephones.

    <h2>
      Rapid Expansion Beginning in 2000
    </h2>
    <p>
      <a href="/knowledge/Franchising.html" title="View 'franchising' definition from Wikipedia" class="knldlink" rel="nofollow">Franchising</a> inquiries were beginning to pour in; during 2000 all available
      locations in Canada were snapped up, and franchises began to open around
      the United States in cities like Portland, San Francisco, Minneapolis,
      Chicago, and Buffalo, New York. The pace of growth increased even more
      rapidly in 2001, and by the end of that year the firm had 31 locations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2002 1-800-GOT-JUNK? moved its headquarters into a 9,000-square-foot
      location in Vancouver that had been vacated by a bankrupt dot.com. Dubbed
      "The Junktion," the space was outfitted with office
      furniture that had been purchased for 10 cents on the dollar, along with
      items that had been salvaged from refuse pickups.
    </p>
    <p>
      The firm's call center now employed 32 customer service
      representatives, who handled between 800 and 1,000 calls per day. Most
      were answered live, rather than by a computerized system, and virtually
      all calls were taken within 60 seconds. To serve all of North America, the
      center was open from 4:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Pacific time. As with
      1-800-GOT-JUNK?'s other employees, call center staff members were
      given incentives, which included commissions and preferred call routing
      for those who closed the highest percentage of sales. For 2002, the
      company, which now had 400 employees, took in revenues estimated at $7
      million.
    </p>
    <p>
      1-800-GOT-JUNK? was receiving media attention from the likes of CNN and 
      <i>
        Fortune
      </i>
       magazine, and interested parties were flooding the firm with requests for
      new franchises. The company offered a money-back guarantee to the select
      few it chose if a franchise did not have revenues of more than $100,000 in
      its first year.
    </p>
    <div>
      <h3>
        Company Perspectives:
      </h3>
      <p>
        <i>
          The company's vision is to continue to be the largest provider
          of junk removal in North America. We set the standards in our industry
          and we are viewed as leaders in the service industry.
        </i>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      In <a href="/knowledge/October_2003.html" title="View 'october 2003' definition from Wikipedia" class="knldlink" rel="nofollow">October 2003</a> the firm unveiled a new online booking option that enabled
      clients to set up service without any human interaction. It was promoted
      with motorcades of 1-800-GOT-JUNK? trucks through the company's
      franchise markets. For 2003 systemwide revenues topped $12 million, with
      the Vancouver,
       Toronto, and San Francisco territories accounting for more than $1
      million each. The company was now averaging $238 per pickup, which
      corresponded to half a truckload of trash.

    <h2>
      100th Franchise in 2004
    </h2>
    <p>
      In <a href="/knowledge/July_2004.html" title="View 'july 2004' definition from Wikipedia" class="knldlink" rel="nofollow">July 2004</a> the firm celebrated the awarding of its 100th franchise.
      1-800-GOT-JUNK? now served 46 metropolitan areas in the United States and
      Canada, with 90 percent of franchises located south of the border. Sales
      had increased more than 100 percent for the fourth consecutive year, with
      systemwide revenues hitting $38.6 million.
    </p>
    <p>
      A franchise now cost $18,000 for an exclusive territory with a population
      of 125,000, plus another $6,000 for a marketing package. Additional
      territories were priced at $8,000 each. The firm continued to collect
      approximately 15 percent of gross revenues in royalties and to fund call
      center operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May 2005 1-800-GOT-JUNK? announced that it would begin using MapPoint
      Location Server software on its Vancouver trucks as part of a <a href="/knowledge/Microsoft.html" title="View 'microsoft' definition from Wikipedia" class="knldlink" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>
      pilot project. Drivers would carry Web-enabled smart phones that could
      display work orders and maps, and the cell-phone locating capabilities of
      Sprint would pinpoint the closest truck to a pickup, which would reduce
      fuel costs and driving time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spring also saw the firm forge an alliance with Oakleaf Waste
      Management, which represented a network of 3,500 independent haulers.
      Oakleaf would refer business to 1-800-GOT-JUNK? in exchange for a 5
      percent referral fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the summer of 2005 the firm had awarded more than 150 franchises,
      including one that was set to open in Sydney, Australia. Systemwide
      revenues of $75 million were projected for the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little more than 15 years after Brian Scudamore had started a summertime
      trash hauling service, 1-800-GOT-JUNK? LLC had grown into a 150-franchise
      chain with a presence in 48 of the top 50 markets in North America. The
      firm's high-tech approach to what had once been the province of
      small-time operators with rusty pickup trucks was one key to its success,
      as was a healthy dose of marketing flair. Under its young owner's
      continued guidance, the company's future appeared bright.
