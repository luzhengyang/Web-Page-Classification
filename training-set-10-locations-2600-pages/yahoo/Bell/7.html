                        <h4>Greetings From The Vancouver Lions</h4>

                        <p>If you are looking for the web site of the Vancouver Lions Club that is located in America’s Vancouver, <a href="http://www.cityofvancouver.us">Vancouver, Washington USA</a>, this is it! You have found us!</p>

                        <p>If, however, you were trying to find the <a href="http://www.vancouverlions.com/index.html">Vancouver Cathay New Century Lions Club</a>, or perhaps the Vancouver <a href="http://www.bclions.com/">BC Lions</a> football team, they are both located in Canada‘s Vancouver—a short, 4 hour 52 minute, 305 mile drive North, in Vancouver, British Columbia Canada.</p>

      <p>No matter what the circumstance that brought you here, we are very happy you found us. And now that you know <a href="meetings.php">where</a> we are, please accept an open invitation to spend some time  learning about <a href="members.php">who</a> we are, <a href="projects.php">what</a> we do, <a href="projects.php">how</a> we serve our community, and maybe even a little bit about <a href="join.php">why</a> we are Lions.</p> 

                      <h4>Who We Are</h4>

                        <p>The Vancouver Lions Club is an independent, non-profit corporation, located in <a href="http://www.ci.vancouver.wa.us/">Vancouver, Washington USA</a>. Chartered as a member of the <a href="http://www.lionsclubs.org/EN/index.shtml">International Association Of Lions Clubs</a> on September 12, 1928, it was the first Lions club in <a href="http://www.co.clark.wa.us/">Clark County</a>, <a href="http://access.wa.gov/">Washington</a>, and is now one of the the oldest and longest–serving Lions clubs in the world.</p>


                        <p>The Vancouver Lions Club is a part of District 19G of Lions Clubs International and it is also a member of <a href="http://lionsmd19.com/">Multiple District 19</a> (“MD 19”) of Lions Clubs International. We are one of 46 Lions and Lioness clubs located in District 19G (Southwest Washington state, USA), and one of 11 Lions clubs that are located within Zone 2 of District G (which includes most of Clark County, Washington). MD 19 includes all Lions clubs Districts located in Washington state, the Province of British Columbia, Canada and Northern Idaho.</p>
                        
                        <h4>What We Do</h4>

                        <p class="first_paragraph">In 1925 <a href="helen_keller.php">Helen Keller</a> challenged Lions to become "Knights of the blind." Since then Lions everywhere have been committed to blindness prevention, and have been recognized throughout the world for their service to the blind and visually impaired.</p>

                        <p>The Vancouver Lions Club focuses much of its service activities on helping the students at the <a href="http://www.wssb.wa.gov/">Washington State School For The Blind</a> (the “WSSB”), the <a href="http://www.wssb.wa.gov/foundation/">Pacific Foundation For Blind Children</a> (the “PFBC”), the <a href="http://www.pianotuningschool.org/">School Of Piano Technology for the Blind</a> (the “Piano Hospital”), and the <a href="http://www.wsd.wa.gov/">Washington School for the Deaf</a> (the “WSD”). The Vancouver Lions brought the, now familiar, <em>White Cane Days</em> fund drive to our community, and our members founded what is now known as the Interservice <a href="http://www.walkandknock.org/">Walk And Knock</a> food drive, an annual food drive conducted the first weekend each December that has been embraced by almost every service club in our community.</p>

                        <p>Our Club endorses the charitable programs of <a href="http://www.lionsclubs.org/EN/index.shtml">Lions Clubs International</a>, such as SightFirst (a program designed to eliminate preventable blindness around the world), <a href="http://www.care.org/">CARE</a> (an organization that helps people in the poorest communities in the world), <a href="http://www.lionsclubs.org/EN/lci-foundation/index.php">Lions Clubs International Foundation</a> (a charitable foundation that provides humanitarian services, disaster relief and vocational assistance), and <a href="http://www.lions-quest.org"> Lions Quest</a> (a program that increases academic achievement, decreases problem behaviors and improves pro–social behaviors for school age children). Our Lions were instrumental in creating, and actively participate in the <a href="sight_foundation.php">Lions Sight Foundation of Clark County</a> and the <a href="hearing_foundation.php"> Lions Hearing And Speech Conservation Committee Of Clark County </a> to distribute eyeglasses, hearing aids and medical assistance to persons with sight or hearing disabilities throughout Clark County, Washington.</p>

                        <h4>We serve</h4>

                        <p>Lions Clubs International has impacted the lives of millions all over the world. Through signature projects, Lions are able to help in the areas of sight, health, youth, the elderly, the environment and disaster relief.</p>
                        
                        <img src="images/centennial_logo.gif" alt="centennial logo">

                        <p>Founded in 1917, Lions are best known for fighting blindness; But Lions also feed the hungry, aid seniors and the disabled, and care for the environment. Lions are a global service network of volunteers that make a difference in our local communities.</p>

                        <p>By conducting vision screenings, equipping hospitals and clinics, distributing medicine and raising awareness of eye disease, Lions work toward the goal of providing vision for all. Through programs such as SightFirst, Lions have helped provide more than 147 million treatments for river blindness, 10 million doses of a sight–saving drug to prevent trachoma, and eye screenings for more than 15 million children. SightFirst targets the major causes of blindness: low vision, trachoma, river blindness, childhood blindness, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. Lions have raised more than $415 million for the SightFirst initiative since it was launched in 1990.</p>
                        
                        <p>Lions community projects often support children and local schools through scholarships, recreation and mentoring. Internationally, Lions offer many programs to empower youth, including the Peace Poster Contest; youth camps and exchanges; and Lions Quest, a positive youth development program.</p>

                        <p>Leo clubs help young people develop leadership skills while impacting their communities through service. There are approximately 157,000 Leos and 6,000 Leo clubs in more than 200 countries and geographic areas worldwide.</p>

                        <p>Lions Clubs International Foundation (LCIF), the official charitable arm of Lions Clubs International, assists Lions clubs with global and large–scale local humanitarian projects that individual CLubs can not otherwise care for on thier own. Since 1968, LCIF has awarded more than $811 million in grants saving sight, supporting youth, providing disaster relief and meeting humanitarian needs. Our local community has been the beneficiary of several LCIF grants. Through the Foundation, Lions are able to extend their reach from local communities to the global community in order to serve those who need us most.</p>

                            <p>The International Association of Lions Clubs, headquartered in Oak Brook, Illinois, is an organization of distinct, independent, service clubs, such as the Vancouver Lions Club.</p>

                            <p>Founded in 1917, <a href="http://www.lionsclubs.org/EN/index.shtml">Lions Clubs International</a> is one of the oldest service club organizations in the world; It is the largest, and the most active, community service organization in the world; It is an organization whose basic cause has bound Lions clubs together for generations. There are now more than 1,360,000 Lions in nearly 46,000 Lions clubs located in 209 countries and geographic areas worldwide.</p>

                            <p>In hospitals and senior centers, in regions battered by natural disaster, in schools and eyeglass recycling centers, Lions are doing community volunteer work, helping, leading, planning and supporting. Because Lions Clubs are local, Lions serve the unique needs of the communities we live in. And because Lions International is global, Lions can address challenges that go beyond borders.</p>

                            <p>Lions support sight programs and services including vision screenings, eye banks and eyeglass recycling, and provide eye care services to those at risk of losing their sight. From providing health programs that focus on hearing loss to supporting efforts to control and prevent diabetes, Lions volunteers are working to improve the health of children and adults around the world. By providing volunteer opportunities and leadership experiences, and in sharing a message of peace through an annual Peace Poster contest, Lions invest in the future by reaching out to young people. From performing hands–on community work and service projects to providing emergency assistance, Lions participate in community and environment programs that improve our communities and protect the environment.</p>

                            <p>No matter where located or how designated, all Lions are bound by a common spirit, united in helping those less fortunate. Our motto is simple: <em><strong>"We Serve"</strong></em>.
