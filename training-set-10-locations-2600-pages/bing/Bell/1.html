<p><font face="verdana, arial"><b>Vancouver</b> is one of the most beautiful ports in the world.  With a mild climate year-round, locals boast they can ski in the morning on the north shore mountains and windsurf in the afternoon at English Bay. It is a very green city with numerous parks, fountains and gardens and a wide variety of recreational activities.</font></p><font face="verdana, arial">

<p>Vancouver has been ranked in recent years:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Best city in the world </b>to live in by the business branch of the Economist Group.<br>
</li><li><b>No. 1 Cruise Port</b> in North America by Berlitz<br>
</li><li><b>Number 1 in the Americas</b> by Condé Nast Traveler magazine.
</li></ul>
<!--The Economist ranking was determined by 12 factors in the categories of health and safety, culture and environment and infrastructure. Also awarded at the ceremonies was Vancouver’s <b>Fairmont Waterfront Hotel</b>, voted the "best hotel in Canada" and <b>Vancouver Island</b>, on which BC's capital city of Victoria is situated, named “Best North American Island”. --> <p></p>

<font face="verdana, arial"><br>
On a clear day, the sailout is magnificent. See photos of Canada Place, Ballantyne Pier and what you will experience as you set sail. From your ship you will see float planes and helicopters taking off and landing, container ships and bulkers coming and going and the SeaBus crossing between downtown and North Vancouver regularly, all against the backdrop of the magnificent north shore mountains. You could very likely see a bald eagle before you sail.</font></p>

<p>Vancouver is served by numerous air lines from around the world. If you book early, you should be able to arrange flights directly to Vancouver. It is reported that since the Open Skies policy was implemented in 1995, Vancouver has grown from 454 direct flights per week into Vancouver from eight US cities, to 674 flights per week from 21 US cities.</p>

<p>The most scenic route to Vancouver is via the Rocky Mountains. Fly to Calgary then take the <b>Rocky Mountaineer Rail journey through the Rockies to Vancouver.</b> Rocky Mountaineer has a variety of tours to choose from to show you the grandeur of Alberta and B.C. Visit the <a href="http://rockymountaineer.com"><b><b>Rocky Mountaineer</b></b></a> &nbsp;web site or call 1-800-665-7245. <!-- Cruise lines also offer Rocky Mountains tours pre and post-cruise. <script language="javascript">

</p><p><b></b>Arriving a day or two early to see Vancouver is a great idea and gives you a chance to recover from your journey before setting off on your cruise. This page contains a lot of useful information for those planning on spending a pre or post cruise stay in Vancouver.</p>

<center><a name="seattle"></a><b><font size="+1">ARRIVING &nbsp; FROM&nbsp; SEATTLE</font></b></center>

<p><b>Quick Shuttle</b> offers bus service between Seattle Tacoma Airport, Downtown Seattle, Bellingham Airport and Vancouver. <!--The adult fare between Seattle airport and Canada Place pier in Vancouver costs CDN$46.00 one way $83.00 return. Seniors $44. one way $79 return. -->Call 1-800-665-2122 or book online at <a href="http://www.quickcoach.com"> www.quickcoach.com.</a>

</p><p>The <b>train</b> between Seattle and Vancouver makes a very scenic run, and avoids long waits at the border. It leaves Seattle in the morning and arrives before noon in Vancouver. (It returns to Seattle from Vancouver in the evening.) Both Canada Place and Ballantyne Pier are about a 15-minute taxi ride from the station. Check <a href="http://www.amtrak.com"> www.amtrak.com</a> for rates and times.</p>

<p><b>Cruise Lines often fly passengers to Seattle and bring them by coach to Vancouver.</b> The coach ride is 3 hours which, on top of a long flight can make for a very tiring start to your vacation. It may be possible to request an air deviation, for specific flights of your choice. If the Cruise Line is able to comply with your request, there is a service charge, normally around $75.00 per passenger. Discuss this with your agent when booking your cruise.</p>

<!--<p>Legacy Limousine offers a service between Seattle airport and Vancouver. See <a href="http://www.legacylimousine.ca/"> www.legacylimousine.ca</a> or call toll free 1-866-244-7090.</p>-->

<p>Pacific Coach Lines provides drop-offs and pick-ups at both Canada Place Pier and Ballantyne Pier, to and from Victoria during the cruise ship season from May to September. Visit their web site at <a href="http://www.pacificcoach.com"> www.pacificcoach.com</a>.</p>

<p>If you are driving onto the ferry in the summer be sure to book ahead. Lineups can be long and people frequently wait for more than one sailing.  I wouldn't want you to miss your ship in Vancouver. For schedules and fare see the BC ferries web site at <a href="http://www.bcferries.bc.ca"> www.bcferries.bc.ca</a>.</p>

<center><a name="car"></a><b><font size="+1">CAR&nbsp; RENTAL, &nbsp;DRIVING&nbsp; TO&nbsp;VANCOUVER &nbsp;AND&nbsp; PARKING</font></b></center>

<p><b>Those renting  car to drive to Vancouver </b>can drop off at the rental office in Vancouver. Some companies offer a shuttle bus service to the pier from the car rental office.  Alamo and National  have an office in the Pan Pacific Hotel at Canada Place, so you may be able to arrange to drop off at that location. Several companies have booths at the Canada Place cruise ship level including Avis, Budget and National but these are for car pick up after your cruise only. Be sure to check with your car rental company for exact details re. drop off or pickup in downtown Vancouver when booking. </p>

<p><b>Note that driving from Seattle is about a three hour drive</b> but border crossing delays can be as long as three hours in the summer if security is on high alert. Especially on weekends, the border crossing can really delay you getting to your ship so be sure to drive up a day ahead so you don't miss the boat. </p>
<p><b>Canadian citizens renting a car to drive back to Canada from Seattle</b>  must have a car with Canadian licence plates to cross the border. Let your rental company know that you are Canadian when making a one-way rental. Avis was very accomodating on my recent one-way drive, Seattle to Vancouver and made sure we had a car with Canadian plates.</p>

<p><b>Secured parking facilities</b> are available during your cruise through the following companies:</p>
<p><strong>CANADA PLACE AND THE  VINCI PARK PARKING FACILITY,</strong> located  at the North end of Howe Street at Canada Place Way, is the  only Vancouver <strong>onsite parking facility for the Canada  Place Cruise Ship Terminal. </strong>It is &nbsp;accessible 24 hours per day from the Canada  Place Way entrance. </p>
<p>Canada Place is home to the Vancouver  Convention and Exhibition Centre, the Pan Pacific Hotel, <strong>Port Metro Vancouver Cruise Ship Terminal</strong>, and the World Trade  Centre Office Complex.<br>
    <br>
  With over 750 stalls, the VINCI Park facility is able to offer  solutions for all your parking needs, from short term visitors to monthly  parkers, hotel guests, event exhibitors and <strong>cruise ship  guests</strong>. &nbsp;The company offers cruise ship discounts. You  will enjoy one of the many cruises knowing your vehicle is in a secured  location.

<a name="SHIP"></a>



<br><br>



<center><b><font size="+1">FROM &nbsp;THE &nbsp;AIRPORT &nbsp;TO &nbsp;YOUR &nbsp;SHIP</font></b></center>


<p>It is about a half an hour to 45 minute drive to your cruise terminal from <b>Vancouver International Airport</b>. You will be met by cruise line representatives in the arrivals area of the airport. They will answer any questions you may have, and deal with any problems. Coaches will take you to your ship.</p>
<p> <strong>If you do not have a cruise line transfer</strong>, you can usually purchase one from the representative at the airport upon arrival.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Canada Line Skytrain Service</b> This light rail service from the airport to downtown is now open. It takes around 20 minutes to get downtown. Get off at  Waterfront Station for Canada Place or to take a taxi to Ballantyne Pier. Fares are the same as the Translink service however there is a $5 AddFare for tickets purchased from a ticket vending machine at the three stations closest to the airport.   The state of the art system has certainly enhanceed airport transportation options and is a huge success. <a href="http://www.translink.ca/en/Rider-Info/Canada-Line.aspx"> Get comlete details here.</a></li>
<br>
<li><b>Taxis</b> For independent travellers not using the cruise line transfer, the taxi fare to your ship or downtown hotel is about $30.00. If you are staying in a downtown hotel before or after your cruise, the taxi fare is about $15.00 to Canada Place and $20.00 to Ballantyne Pier including tip.</li><br>

<li><b>Limos</b> are also waiting for you at the airport. This often works out better for families and those with a lot of luggage. The price is set for the trip into town and is not much more than a taxi. <!-- To pre-book a limousine, see <a href="http://www.legacylimousine.ca/"> www.legacylimousine.ca</a> or call toll free 1-866-244-7090, local: 604-312-0500.--></li><br>

<li><b>Car Rentals</b> are of course available at the airport.  You can drop off your car at the downtown office or at the pier. Some companies have an office at Canada Place and Ballantyne Pier. Other companies offer a shuttle service to the pier for cruise passengers including Avis at the Hotel Vancouver (Hornby Street location). Check with your rental company for the current arrangements.

<!--<p><b>Sailing from Canada Place or Ballantyne Pier?</b><br> -->

<i><b>The Port of Vancouver's <a href="http://www.portmetrovancouver.com/about/cruiseandtourism/cruiselineschedules.aspx">Cruise Schedule</a> indicates which ships are sailing from Canada Place and Ballantyne Pier. It should be available for this year in February.</b></i></div>
</font>

<div align="center"><p><a href="http://www.susanmilne.com/piers.htm#TOP"><i>Photos of Vancouver's Piers</i></a></p></div>
<br>
<p>There are two cruise terminals in Vancouver:<b> Canada Place
and Ballantyne Pier.</b> Both offer state of the art facilities for provisioning cruise ships and meeting passengers' needs. </p>

<p>Located downtown, <b>Canada Place</b> was the Canada
Pavilion at Expo'86. Today it is home to the Pan Pacific Hotel, Vancouver
Trade and Convention Centre and an IMAX theatre as well as being a cruise
terminal. The Fairmont Waterfront Hotel is located directly across
the road, recently named the best hotel in the city by the readers of  Condé Nast Traveler magazine.</p>

<p><b>Canada Place was extended</b> a couple of years ago and can accommodate a third megaship. The cruise level has been re-designed to handle the increasing number of passengers and taxis more efficiently. A few shops and kiosks have opened on the cruise ship level as well as a tourist information centre. For photos of Canada Place see the  <a href="sailout.htm">Vancouver Sailout</a> &nbsp;page and the <a href="http://www.susanmilne.com/piers.htm"> Vancouver Piers photo page.</a>

</p><p>Further East from downtown, beyond the container terminal, <b>Ballantyne Pier</b> can welcome one or two ships. To get to Ballantyne from downtown, take Georgia Street East (away from Stanley Park). The road becomes a bridge between the dome stadiums BC Place and GM Place then it returns to ground level, renamed Prior Street. Keep going and turn left on Clarke Drive and continue over the bridge and around to the port security entrance. From there turn right, drive a few minutes to Ballantyne and turn right to drive up to the entrance or enter the parking area.</p>

<p>Ballantyne Pier reopened in 1995 after a major renovation and expansion which enables this facility to handle the new generation of megaships now on the Alaska run. The need for a larger container port caused the west side to be land filled so we lost the west pier at Ballantyne.  This terminal is very spacious and easy to get around. The taxi service operates very smoothly at Ballantyne. The sailout is not as pretty as from Canada Place and it is difficult to wave friends off to Alaska as the small viewing area is in front of the ship's bow. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ballantyne is a little remote and the area between the pier and the city center is the worst part of Vancouver.<b> It is essential to stay in a downtown hotel and take a taxi to or from Ballantyne. You are advised  not to walk. </b> It is a 15 to 20 minute taxi ride from downtown to Ballantyne and with a wait in the taxi queue and a tip, it costs about $20.00. <!-- On the days when <B>Crystal Harmony</B> calls at Ballantyne on her cruise from San Francisco, a shuttle bus to the city center is provided by the cruise line -  an excellent service. --></p>

<!-- <p>Cruise lines have been swapping ships between Seattle and Vancouver to suit passenger demand. The increasing number of ships sailing from Seattle is of concern to Vancouver where numbers have dropped since a peak of 1.25 million in 2002, to just over 900,000 in 2007. As part of the port's plans to further develop Vancouver's cruise industry, a new company has been hired to manage the cruise ship terminals at Ballantyne Pier and Canada Place starting this year. Cerescorpo Co. specializes in cruise terminal operations and development.</p>-->

<p>For photos of Ballantyne Pier see the <a href="http://www.susanmilne.com/piers.htm#TOP">Vancouver Piers </a> &nbsp;page.</p>

<a name="arrival"> </a>
<center><b><font size="+1">ARRIVAL &nbsp;AT&nbsp; THE&nbsp; PIER</font></b></center>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Boarding commences between 11:00am and 2:00pm depending on the cruise line with lunch available onboard throughout the afternoon. </li><li>When you arrive at the ship, your luggage will be taken from you and delivered to your cabin. Tipping is now allowed and you may find the baggage handlers lingering in the hope of getting one. </li><li>You are then free to proceed through check in, immigration and security with just your hand luggage. </li><li>Keep your passport, ticket and credit card handy for check-in and be prepared for a wait at U.S. customs especially if the security alert is high.  </li><li>Also be sure to have your smile ready for that "welcome aboard" photograph. Remember, once you are through the boarding procedures you are fee to unpack and enjoy your cruise!</li></ul><p></p>

<p>** Cruise lines offer priority check-in for past passengers so be sure to ask about this if you don't see the separate kiosks for this purpose. Also be sure to ask a representative for assistance if you need a wheel chair,  are unable to stand in a long queue or have other special needs.</p>

<a href="#TOP">TOP</a>

<a name="HOTEL"></a>

<br>

<center><b><font size="+1">HOTELS / BED &amp; BREAKFAST LINKS</font></b></center>

<p>Cruise lines charge a per person rate to book a hotel room so it is usually more economical to book a room yourself.</p>

<p>If you are sailing from Ballantyne Pier, you will need to stay downtown and take a taxi to your ship as there are no hotels near Ballantyne. A taxi to Canada Place from a downtown hotel is around $15.00 including tip and a wait in the taxi queue.</p>

<p>I find hotel packages are usually the best value. The Pan Pacific and Waterfront are luxury hotels with packages for cruise passengers. </p>

<!--<P>Room Rates given are for the seven hotels closest to Canada Place.
<BR>These are regular July rates in CANADIAN dollars. Many hotels feature Alaska cruise passenger specials so be sure to mention you are sailing when you book. <br>(The U.S. exchange rate is aprox U.S.$1.00 = CDN$1.30.)<br><br>

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.translink.ca"><b><i>Vancouver Transit Website - www.translink.ca</i></b></a></div>

<font face="verdana, arial">
<p>To get you started when you arrive, there is a lot of useful attraction information in the front of the yellow pages which should be in your hotel room.</p>

<p>A good first stop is the <a href="http://www.tourism-vancouver.org" target="new"><b>Vancouver Tourist Office</b></a> at the foot of Burrard Street, across from Canada Place at the harbour. Here you will find an exhaustive resource of information for your visit including bus and ferry timetables and sample menues from local restaurants. A supply of pamphlets of places of interest can be found in hotels, malls, restaurants and car rental offices. </p>

<p>Those calling at Vancouver for a day will find tourist information at the kiosk on the cruise level of Canada Place.</p>

<p><b>Getting around Vancouver</b> is normally easy and a lot can be seen
by walking the downtown area.
</p><ul>
<li>An excellent bus, SeaBus and SkyTrain service connects the lower mainland by <a href="http://www.translink.ca"> Translink.</a> </li><br>
<li>It costs $2.50, $1.75 for seniors and kids for one zone. (On weekdays from start of service to 6:30pm, the area is divided into 3 zones with a small surcharge for each zone).  </li><br>
<li>Day passes are a good option for visitor.</li><br>
<li>Maps of the zones and timbetalbes are located at bus stops and SeaBus and SkyTrain stations. Timetables can be picked up at the Tourist Office and are available <a href="http://www.translink.bc.ca">online</a> and by calling the number at bus stops on your cell.</li><br>
<li><b>Your transfer is good for 1 1/2 hours </b>and can be used on buses, the SkyTrain and SeaBus. </li><br>
<li>A trip across the harbour on the SeaBus can give you an excellent view of the cruise ships in port for the day. The SeaBus leaves from Waterfront Station, the restored Canadian Pacific Station, a short walk from Canada Place on the edge of Gastown.</li></ul><p></p>

<p><b>Hop-On-Off-Service</b> is offered by the <a href="http://www.vancouvertrolley.com"><strong>Vancouver Trolley Company.</strong></a> They stop at all major attractions and you can get on and off as you please: Makes 23 stops. Reservations are not necessary. Tickets can be purchased from guides or from the driver when you board. There are many pickup spots downtown including Canada Place, the Art Gallery, Sheraton Wall Centre, Virgin Megastore and all major tourist attractions. Payment by cash or travelers cheques (Canadian or American funds). Call toll free: 1-888-451-5581.</p>

<!--<li>Gray Line's <a href="http://www.grayline.ca/tours/pages/graylineca/graylineca_604_DeckerTrolleyLoo.asp"><b>double decker attractions loop</b></a> ticket is valid for 2 days and makes 21 stops.  Reserve 48 hours in advance.  Call Toll free: 1-800-667-0082.<br><br>-->

<p><b>Car rental offices</b> are scattered downtown and most hotels have a rental office or pickup service. It can be difficult to rent in Vancouver in the high season so be sure to <b>book ahead</b> if you are sure you will need a car. Parking is expensive and can be awkward downtown so if you are not planning on going out of town, you will find it easier to walk or take transit.</p>

<p><b>Victoria and Whistler</b> make good day trips and there are a number of ways to get there: by car, public transit or tour. 
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rockymountaineer.com" target="new">The Rocky Mountaineer "Whistler Sea to Cky Climb" </a> gives you the option of a day trip, or staying overnight before returning to Vancouver. </li><br>

The world class Aquarium features a dolphin show, beluga whales, sea lions, sea otters, indoor and outdoor displays and a tropical area. The park also has a totem pole display, kids railway, nature trails, tennis courts, pitch and putt, swimming pool, beaches, seawall for walking, biking and roller blading and excellent vantage points for watching ships sailout.
<p>The free <a href="http://vancouver.ca/parks/parks/stanley/shuttle.htm"><b>SHUTTLE BUS</b></a> circles the park each summer (2009 dates and times are not yet posted. Normally from mid June to late September, 10:00 am - 6:30 pm.) The special fleet of buses offers frequent - every 12-15 minutes - pick-up service. The Shuttle has 15 specially signed stops hitting the park's most popular attractions and natural highlights.</p>  
<!--<p>As of spring 2008 - The park is not completely cleared up from the devastating winds of December 2006 which took out many of the trees so you can still see some of the damage. The sea wall has reopened for walking the perimeter. The historic hollow tree is having to be laid on its side as it can no longer stand on its own.</p> </font></TD>
