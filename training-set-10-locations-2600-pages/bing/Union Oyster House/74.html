Not the best start but we were excited about the food ahead. Four of us were eating so started with the oyster platter which was mediocre and overcooked. Moving on to the main courses one group member went for the swordfish which was overcooked and tasteless. I went for the broiled seafood combo which was pretty tasty and on the whole pretty well cooked. The other two went for the stuffed sole. This was the biggest let down of the whole evening, the sole was very overcooked and filled with stuffing which had the texture of wallpaper paste and was very bitter. On the whole the meal was poor and expensive and I'm left wondering what all the fuss is about. My friends who live in Boston and eat out quite a bit there couldn't beleive how bad the whole experience was. If you value going just because of the history of the place rather than the quality of the food then go for it but if you are after top notch food go elsewhere.</p></span>

    <time itemprop="dateCreated" datetime="2013-12-20">Dec 20</time>.
    <span itemprop="reviewBody"><p class="review_text description">This is America's oldest restaurant and it has visitors ranging from politicians, historical figures to celebrities. With a great history behind it, Union Oyster House has been featured in Travel channel and Food Network. Therefore, it is one of my must-visit stop to Boston despite some mediocre reviews I saw.</p>

<p class="review_text description">It looks like this restaurant still keeps it old design and decor with some posters and photos of celebrities who came to dine here. They have a bar on the first floor and quieter dining areas and private party rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floor. After an hour or so wait, we finally got seated and our waiter was super friendly and nice.</p>

<p class="review_text description">Since I don't eat oysters, I have my boyfriend do the honor for me, ordering a dozen of the native oysters. We also shared a bowl of their famous Clam Chowder. For entree, he got the boiled Seafood Platter and I got the Seafood Newburg.</p>

<p class="review_text description">The clam chowder is very thick and creamy. They definitely add a ton of heavy cream in it and it is undoubtedly tasty. Honestly, I think they could add more clams. Oysters on the other hand, according to my boyfriend, are very fresh and contain little after-taste. I really like my entree, Seafood Newburg. It is consist of shrimp, lobster meat and scallops sauteed in creamy sauce with a cream puff and side of rice pilaf. They gave you a generous portion of seafood and the creamy sauce is just perfect.</p>

<p class="review_text description">The boiled seafood platter is amazing too. They gave you salmon, scallops, sword fish and shrimps with potatoes. My boyfriend and I were both stuffed at the end. What do we think of Union Oyster House? It serves pretty damn good seafood and just think about the fact that JFK, Sam Adam and other famous people used to dine here, I could say I have been here too!</p></span>

    <p class="review_text description">This is America's oldest restaurant and it has visitors ranging from politicians, historical figures to celebrities. With a great history behind it, Union Oyster House has been featured in Travel channel and Food Network. Therefore, it is one of my must-visit stop to Boston despite some mediocre reviews I saw.</p>

<p class="review_text description">It looks like this restaurant still keeps it old design and decor with some posters and photos of celebrities who came to dine here. They have a bar on the first floor and quieter dining areas and private party rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floor. After an hour or so wait, we finally got seated and our waiter was super friendly and nice.</p>

<p class="review_text description">Since I don't eat oysters, I have my boyfriend do the honor for me, ordering a dozen of the native oysters. We also shared a bowl of their famous Clam Chowder. For entree, he got the boiled Seafood Platter and I got the Seafood Newburg.</p>

<p class="review_text description">The clam chowder is very thick and creamy. They definitely add a ton of heavy cream in it and it is undoubtedly tasty. Honestly, I think they could add more clams. Oysters on the other hand, according to my boyfriend, are very fresh and contain little after-taste. I really like my entree, Seafood Newburg. It is consist of shrimp, lobster meat and scallops sauteed in creamy sauce with a cream puff and side of rice pilaf. They gave you a generous portion of seafood and the creamy sauce is just perfect.</p>

<p class="review_text description">The boiled seafood platter is amazing too. They gave you salmon, scallops, sword fish and shrimps with potatoes. My boyfriend and I were both stuffed at the end. What do we think of Union Oyster House? It serves pretty damn good seafood and just think about the fact that JFK, Sam Adam and other famous people used to dine here, I could say I have been here too!</p>
    <p class="smFnt review_pros">Pros: Historical, big portion and fresh seafood</p>
    <p class="smFnt review_cons">Cons: slightly overpriced and touristy</p>

    <p class="review_text description">The Union Oyster house was one of the most interesting restaurants I went to on my recent trip to Boston.  That it's filled with history goes without saying.  The raw oysters were great, very meaty.  Very reasonable priced and our waitress was funny and very attentive.  Great experience!</p>
    <p class="smFnt review_pros">Pros: Historic, delicious oysters, gift shop!</p>
    <p class="smFnt review_cons">Cons: Crowded downstairs</p>

So we went ahead and put in our name, and ended up waiting 45 minutes. This in itself would have been fine, but once we were seated and had ordered, it took another 45 minutes to receive our appetizers, and then another 45 minutes after that to receive our entrees. All told, we spent about an hour eating and 2 hours waiting for service. This is ridiculous on a Tuesday night. On top of that, our waitress forgot one person's soda and we waited 30 minutes for that; she assumed that the child in our party would not want the cole slaw that came with her fish and chips; and the potatoes that were supposed to come with the Shore Dinner were completely missing. To her credit, when we asked about the potatoes and cole slaw at the end of the meal, she apologized and said she should not have assumed about the slaw, and offered to give us the potatoes to take home. These are small consolations for the obnoxiously long wait, though. The food itself was good, but nothing to write home about. Certainly not worth the prices nor the wait.</p></span>

The prices are a little high, but that is because its near Fanieul Hall. The service was good as well. The only negative I found was that the booths are small.

    <p class="review_text description">This place definately has some ambience. The food was very good. We both had the lobster rolls and the clam chowder. The prices are a little high, but that is because its near Fanieul Hall. The service was good as well. The only negative I found was that the booths are small. I watched quite a few average sized men have trouble climbing in.</p>

    <span itemprop="reviewBody"><p class="review_text description">Found this restaurant in the City Pass book and thought we could not go wrong eating here. We ordered our free lobster ravioli and a cup of chowder to start. The waitress brought out the appetizers and I must say the chowder was great, the free lobster ravioli also tasted great. We noticed that the 11.99 ravioli appetizer was only two ravioli's on a small plate. I would have been extremely disapointed if I had to pay for this but it was free so no biggy!\r
<br>\r
<br>The waitress then took our entree orders, my girlfriend ordered the stuffed sole and was warned that this was a bad choice because you only get a few tiny pieces of fish in a lot of batter. Why is it on the menu if there is nothing good about the dish? She suggested a change to her order and I ordered the sword fish.\r
<br>\r
<br>The food came out and my girlfriends entree was certainly full of fish, the problem was that it was a fried fish in batter with little to no taste. For 19.95 I could have found a walk up fish/chip stand and gotten this for 6.99. My meal came and I dug in but was not too excited about what I found. My sword fish tasted like oil, no taste at all to the meal, for 24.99 you expect some type of flavor. I must also add that my water glass had dried bits of food on the inside!\r
<br>\r
<br>Even receiving the bill was odd and lacked class, The standard black wallet they bring your bill in was missing. The waitress brought the bill and dropped it on the table I picked it up and put my credit card on the table while I read over the bill. She made another pass of the table and scooped up my credit card. Check out was fast just seemed to lack class.\r
<br>\r
<br>Over all it seemed that the restaurant did the minimum to get by and the goal was all about saving money. It seems that they are riding on the pricipal that all of the tourist will try it once.\r
<br>\r
<br>I highly recomend that you do not go to this restaurant and tell everyone you know the same. I wish there was some way to remove this restaurants add out of the City Pass Book.</p></span>

He repeatedly asked me if our waitress was just busy and if that was the reason for her poor attitude.

The spaces are small and crowded, though the architecture and bits of historical info posted throughout are interesting to look it.  I would not recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston and will not be a repeat customer. The Jersey shore serves better lobster dinners than this place for half the cost.</p></span>

The wait was extremely long even though we had reservations, the service was not good and the prices were high.  The spaces are small and crowded, though the architecture and bits of historical info posted throughout are interesting to look it.  I would not recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston and will not be a repeat customer. The Jersey shore serves better lobster dinners than this place for half the cost.</p>

I went here with my father and sister after my sister was inducted into the MA bar. We were so excited and happy. When we walked in no one spoke to us, even though there were two employees standing right there. They ignored us for about 5 min until I finally asked if we could choose our own seating. They just looked at us and said yeah. The waitress came to out table and curtly introduced herself. She was very brusk and didn't seem to want to serve us. When we were ordering I asked her a question about one of the dishes to which she VERY rudely replied. When I accidently dropped my fork and tried politely to get her attention, she never came over. When I tried to order something to drink, she never came over. I was finally able to order something to drink when she brought out our food (which she essentially threw on the table). One of the dishes we ordered was a baked and stuffed 1 pound lobster. What we got was about 5 small bites of stuffing and two small bites of lobster. I love lobster and know how much lobster meat there is in a 1 pound lobster - this fell VERY short of 1 pound, I would say 2 ounces was more like it and they charged us $40 for it. Overall, the food was not good and the waitress was the RUDEST I have ever had in my entire life. I would like to note that my family and I are incredibly polite people. I still cannot believe that this restaurant exists under such poor management. I personally think they are riding on the fact that they are the oldest restaurant in America, but in my opinion, that's not enough.</p></span>
