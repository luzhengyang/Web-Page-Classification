<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iamkris</div><div class="date">September 19, 2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I took a long lunch today to run up to the Bass Pro Shop in Gurnee IL (about an hour north of Chicago) and use their range (which I often do when limited on time and can't make it to my club).  I've been shooting a 3-gun match that utilizes a pistol caliber carbine instead of rifle cartridge and while I've been shooting a Win 92 in 45 Colt, recently picked up a Mech Tech CCU unit for my 1911 to use (gotta love common caliber and magazines).  I've been having a little problem with FTEs so I went up for a short range session to test out a new load with my pistol and the carbine unit.  <br>
<br>
http://www.mechtechsys.com/images/CCU-Glock_sm.jpg <br>
<br>
After running through the safety gauntlet (written inventory of everything I had, locks on all the guns, zip ties on my range bag and gun case) I make my way to the range.  <br>
<br>
The guy at the counter points at my pistol conversion and says "you can't shoot that here."  <br>
<br>
I say "Oh, its a 45 ACP"<br>
<br>
He says "you can't shoot an assault rifle here"<br>
<br>
Me (getting a bit steamed) "No, it's a 1911 with a longer barrel"<br>
<br>
He says "You can't shoot something that looks like that.  You can shoot your pistol but not that.  Not my rule...just policy."<br>
<br>
Now Bass Pro proclaims itself a cut above the regular discount store when it comes to guns and hunting.  This one even sponsors cop training, hunter training and even pin shooting.  I politely but firmly tell him the corporate policy stinks and will undermine shooting and hunting everywhere, tear up my range card, turn in my Bass Pro Outdoor Savings card and tell him the store / chain just lost a $500 - $1000 a year customer.  <br>
<br>
After jamming my guns back in the car and listing the number of letters I was going to write (Bass Pro corporate, this store and posts on every internet shooting hunting board I could think of) I decide to go back in and get the straight scoop from the manager.<br>
<br>
They found the Hunting and Shooting department manager.  I calmly explained what happened, told them what I was going to do and stated that the store's policy played right into anti-gunner's laps and would eventually undermine hunting and the right to keep and bear arms.  The department manager accepted my invitation to look at the gun.  She (who was into hunting herself) agreed that it was a pistol and said the only policy she knew of was against AP ammo because it hurt the range bullet trap.  She said she would talk to the rangemaster to ensure that their people were "on the same page". :neener: <br>
<br>
Feeling a little smug, I decided to press her.<br>
<br>
Me:  "If I brought an AR 15 to the rifle tube, could I shoot it?"<br>
<br>
She said "no, it would hurt the bullet trap".  <br>
<br>
Me:  "Well, then could I shoot a .308 hunting rifle I have for deer in the tube?"  <br>
<br>
She says "Yes."<br>
<br>
I ask "You said you hunt, right?  Can you legally shoot a deer with a .223 in most states?" <br>
<br>
She says "No, the cartridge isn't powerful enough"<br>
<br>
Me:  "Well, why can't I shoot an AR?"<br>
<br>
She:  [pauses, looking perplexed]  "Ummm, since we're attached to this outlet mall, it might scare the people here?"  :banghead: <br>
<br>
So, the drama isn't over.  I'm going to check back in with them and see if they've had a chance to look deep into their logic.</div></div><hr>

Besides, it sounds like the guns are locked up until you get inside and at the range area, so how are outside sheeple going to know if you rifle bag has an AR, grandpa's deer gun, or a Barret???<br>
<br>
Now, all that aside, I think (I stress that I'm fuzzy on this memory) that someone explained that small rifles calibers, ie 223, 22-250, 220 swift, etc, are too high of velocity, and really do more damage to CERTAIN types of backstops compared to larger, slower velocity cartridges.  Any truth to this?<br>
<br>
Perhaps that's the actual company policy....at least we can hope there is some logic behind it...</div></div><hr>

 Kamicosmos -- my feeling is that the response I got from Bass Pro was totally based on the LOOKS or cosmetics of the gun versus the caliber.  For heaven's sake, my CCU is a 45 ACP!!!</div></div><hr>

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splat Shot</div><div class="date">September 20, 2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, Bass Pro has been anti-gun (military types) for several years.  I too have gone through the insulting lock-up procedure and here in Texas they do not allow any type of pistol gripped or military rifle on their range.  When I talked with the manager about this she said they were a "hunting store" and evil black rifles were not permitted.  I then asked about a wood stocked, no pistol grip SKS and she again said no way citing its military use.  <br>
<br>
It has nothing to do at all with damage to the range (although I'm sure there are limits) by higher velocity or higher caliber weapons.  It has all to do with looks and political correctness.  I got this straight from management - no ARs or AKs etc allowed, period.  Blood pressure is rising as I type, time to stop.  Splat.</div></div><hr>

Although BPS caters to the hunters and general target shooting public, I have not seen them back anything else, particularly EBR type weapons. Some posts and info from BPS has even been anti-EBR. It would seem to me that BPS is really an anti-2nd hunter's (and fisher's) store.<br>

<br>
Should have asked her if that meant you couldn't shoot any of the various rifles our armed forces have used as sniper rifles.  Sure would hit their range bottom line, if you told everyone wanting to site in a Remington 700 or Winchester M70 that since that model had been used by the military at one time they couldn't shoot there.  Not to mention all those evil Assault Mausers or anyone shooting a Beretta M9 variant or a 1911 style pistol.</div></div><hr>

Their answer? Yes. I then made a reservation for the rifle range, but before I arrived I was told they were experiencing more problems at the range, so I didn't do it (the trouble they've had with their rifle range is non-stop since it opened).<br>
<br>
The guy working there at the time apologized however, and since I made the trip out there for nothing, he let me shoot the pistol range at no cost. Nothing for me to complain about there. geegee</div></div><hr>

We should all challenge this type of thinking.  We should not accept that this is "corporate policy".  Each and every one of us shoudl attempt to shoot something politically incorrect at BPS and when (if) they say no, point out the fallacy of their thinking.<br>
<br>
I read something (Grits Gresham) about the American Sportsman on ABC and their General Motors sponsorship.  GM received lots of letters in the 60's saying that they would never buy a GM again if they kept sponsoring that show (which at the time had full coverage of big game hunts)  GM dropped their sponsor ship and the big game section ended.<br>
<br>
The chairman said that if they had received similar letters saying that people would always buy GM cars, they would have kept sponsoring it.  :uhoh: <br>

I dunno. :confused:  I will tell you that my experience is similar to yours: at first I was told "No Way", I then went there one day as another shooter was exiting-just after putting away his AR15. I asked him if he was shooting it there, and of course he told me yes. I then asked they guy behind the counter, and was told they were perfectly okay, as long as not Class 3. I then made the reservation for my own session (referenced above), but because of their range problem, never actually got to shoot it.<br>

To say they need to get their act together is a huge understatement. geegee</div></div><hr>

Right there is another reason you found hostility to black rifles. Attitude in gunshops will usually reflect that of the citizens that live near it. You live in a state that requires a FOID registration card just to OWN a gun or buy ammo and is distinctly unfriendly to shooters (though not necessarily hunters). I doubt that this is a corporatewide policy for BassProShops, just one that reflects the feeling of a majority of Illinois gunowners.</div></div><hr>

His comments to me-which he made sure to tell me were not to be taken as representing BPS's corporate policy-are that shooting an AR15 at their range is perfectly okay. I told him that in this thread there was a quote by another BPS employee about the AR15's appearance, and he was amazed that someone would actually say that.<br>
<br>
He suggested I call the store and get the email address of the store manager and range manager, and point them toward this thread. geegee</div></div><hr>

So if they're pro-hunting, why can't I sight in my hunting rifle there to ensure minimum suffering on the part of the animal???<br>

In fact, the whole point is, to have influence from the outside (from places where common sense prevails) affect the anti-gun nonsense in places where common sense does not prevail, such as Gurnee, IL, unless it can be rectified by obtaining an apology and reversal of policy in a short time with simple local communication.</div></div><hr>

I had heard they allowed rifles indoors...which in Michigan winters was a great idea.<br>

Anything is ok as long as it is not an "assault weapon"<br>
<br>
He specifically said Ar's and Ak's...but hedged and said "and other weapons like that"<br>
<br>
They would let you shoot 300 Win MAg...but not 223 simply because it looked EVIL.<br>

Any handgun...not matter how evil...was OK</div></div><hr>

Yes, they are complete idiots there, particularly on the range.  Ok, let me see if I can remember my experiences....<br>
<br>
Story one:<br>
<br>
Clerk, "Hey you can't pick through the brass."<br>
Me, "Why not, half of it's mine!"<br>
Clerk, "Oh, well, ok but only take yours."<br>
Me, "Why? What are you gonna do with the rest?"<br>
Clerk, "I don't know but you can't have it, it's our policy."<br>
Me,-clerk turns around, fill bag with .45 brass, clerk clueless as to anything.<br>
<br>
Story two, different day:<br>
<br>
Clerk, "Hey you can't shoot at that target."<br>
Me, " Why?"<br>
Clerk, "It looks like a person."<br>
Me, "It's an IPSC target."<br>
Clerk, "Still looks like a person."<br>
Me, " It's two small boxes, one on top of another, do you see any eyes on it."<br>
Clerk, "Doesn't matter."<br>
Me, -tear off the "head" of IPSC target...., "Is that better?"<br>
Clerk, "Yes."<br>
<br>
Story Three, different day:<br>
<br>
Clerk, "I gotta take the trigger lock off."<br>
Me, "OK,"<br>
Clerk, Takes lock off and slams like shut on a semi custom 1911A1.<br>
Me, " Don't do that again to my gun, it's got a match trigger job and you'll mess it up."<br>
Clerk,"I'ev spend 10 years in teh Army, I know all about 1911's, this won't do anything to it, don't worry about it."<br>
Me, "It's my gun, I spent alotta money on it.  If you slam the slide shut on it again after I asked you not to I'm gonna pistol whip you with it. " <br>
Clerk looks crosseyed and offended.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I usually ask that they leave the action open after they have checked the chamber.  <br>
<br>
After they got rid of most of their handguns due to political pressure I don't shop their anymore.  Try the Outdoorsman in Winthrop Harbor.  Much nicer group of people there.</div></div><hr>

<br>
If indeed you are referring to Firepower in Matthews, NC you are correct.  It is a 50 foot pistol range and they don't allow rifle calibers.  Only handguns, or rifles in Handgun calibers.  Exception of .22 LR and .22 Magnum.  Shotguns with slugs, but for entirely different reasons, they got tired of replacing the ceiling tiles when people tried hip firing their shotguns.</div></div><hr>

Funny stuff! :D  I forgot about the two times I've yaken one of my customers shooting. He's a retired Army Colonel (flew helicopters 3 tours in Viet Nam :eek: ), and each time we were at the front of the store having our pistols checked, the conversation went something like this"<br>
Clerk: "How many clips you have today?"<br>
Colonel: "I have three magazines." <br>
Clerk (to me): "How many clips do you have?"<br>
Colonel: "He has quite a few more magazines than me." Then to me:<br>
               "Tell him how many magazines  you brought..." :rolleyes: <br>
<br>
The clerk never got it, but I was kind of tickled by the whole thing. geegee</div></div><hr>

Have you ever had a drink in your watch hand and someone asks you what time it is?  No, I didn't do that, just wondering if any of you had done that.  My fox paws was when the guy handed me a flat pack of 100 Large Rifle primers after I had asked for Lg Pistol.  I tipped the pack up to read the edge and...  Man, those paks slide apart easy!  OOPS!  All 100.  Turned out he didn't have any Lg Pistol ones or LSWC bullets so I left without buying anything.  He was nice about it though.  I was :o</div></div><hr>


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">campergeek</div><div class="date">September 27, 2003, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sympathetic with the viewpoints listed here from a standpoint of rights.  I also share the opinion that biases against rifles based on appearance are stupid.  In addition, I have no personal connection to Bass Pro Shops.  However...<br>
<br>
It is a private company, and they get to set the range rules however they want.  What follows is mostly hypothetical, because the examples given seem to indicate a clear bias against "evil" rifles, but Bass Pro Shops could set a policy of allowing only "the types of arms we sell" in their range and they would not be violating your rights.<br>
<br>
Understand that, although they sell firearms, BPS is not primarily a gun store.  They are a hunting/fishing/outdoor recreation store.  They can tailor their services to support their purpose however they interpret that.  This means that they get to decide that if your rifle doesn't fit their interpretation of a hunting rifle they can say it's not suitable for their range.  They are built to serve hunters, not military arms enthusiasts, and if somebody is on the range shooting military arms, they're taking up range time that could be used by a hunter (notwithstanding the argument that your military-style rifle may be perfectly suitable for some hunting purposes).<br>
<br>
To provide an analogy, if I am a pistol enthusiast (let's say particularly semi-autos), I may open a range only for semi-auto shooters.  No revolvers, and certainly no rifles or shotguns, even if the range could accommodate such arms.  If you want to shoot another style of arms, you'll be taking up range space that could be used by someone in my target market, and I can choose to refuse to allow you to shoot.  It's my right and my business.<br>
<br>
I'm not suggesting that the policy of some BPSs is founded on this argument, and if it is it should be clearly posted and explained (I'm not even arguing that it's a GOOD policy).  I'm not arguing that people shouldn't write the company to try to change the policy, because I think that's a positive action and it would be good for more people to be exposed to the peaceable use of "evil" rifles, compared to the standard media presentation.  I am simply arguing that it's misguided to say that a private company's policies is an infringement of your rights.  Their company, their policies, even when those are frustrating to some customers (or just plain stupid).</div></div><hr>
