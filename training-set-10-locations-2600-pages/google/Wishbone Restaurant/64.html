		<div itemprop="articleBody">

		<p>On the oak-studded hillside behind Sam Sebastiani’s Sonoma home, a rocky path winds uphill, just a stone’s throw from the house itself. Is it a deer trail? A forgotten hiking path?</p>
<div id="attachment_2420" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 236px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI301_694456.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2420" alt="Sam and Robin Sebastiani at their home." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI301_694456-226x300.jpg" width="226" height="300"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sam and Robin Sebastiani at their home.</p></div>
<p>It’s actually the rustic road that Sam’s grandfather, Samuele Sebastiani, traversed many times a day more than a century ago while hauling cobblestones from the hilltop quarry down to Sonoma Creek for transport to San Francisco. Working at the quarry enabled Samuele to save enough money to build his landmark Sonoma winery, Sebastiani Vineyards, in 1904.</p>
<p>It’s fitting, and eerily coincidental, that 11 decades later, Samuele’s grandson now lives alongside that old quarry road and produces a line of small-batch wines dedicated to the memory of his grandfather.</p>
<p>Sam Sebastiani’s affection for his Italian roots and his wine heritage runs deep, and he revels in surrounding himself with memories of where it all began. Not only is his sprawling home ideally located atop Quarry Hill, but family memorabilia pervades the residence that he, his wife, Robin, and their four dogs have called home since 2008.</p>
<p>Before Sebastiani set eyes on the house, he had recurrent dreams about it. In each of the dreams, he was horseback riding in the hills of his childhood and would come across the house. He was speechless when his real estate agent drove him up to what was — quite literally — the house of his dreams.</p>
<div id="attachment_2421" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI070_694470.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2421" alt="Sam and Robin's dogs sleeping outside the living room." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI070_694470-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sam and Robin’s dogs sleeping outside the living room.</p></div>
<p>“I wanted tranquility, and I wanted privacy,” Sebastiani said. He got it, in spades. The large, single-story Craftsman-style residence was a spec home, so the couple were able to put their own touches on it.</p>
<p>Ceiling panels in the dining room, along with wainscoting throughout the house, are crafted from Sebastiani’s grandfather’s redwood wine barrels. There are paintings of the monastery where Samuele learned to make wine. Hand-carved cask heads from Sebastiani Vineyards flank the dining room window with its spectacular views of Gehricke Canyon.</p>
<p>Since the Sebastianis enjoy cooking — he is renowned in the family for his split-pea soup — there’s a large open kitchen complete with a rack of antique copper pots. Glass pendants collected during a vacation in Venice hang over the island, and the kitchen also features paneling made from Samuele’s wine barrels. The overall effect is that of an Old World Italian kitchen, yet with a touch Samuele could not have seen coming: a dishwasher exclusively for glassware.</p>
<p>The home’s furnishings are eclectic, a mix of American and Italian heritage pieces. Viticultural touches are everywhere, from the grape cluster lines hammered into the copper wet-bar sink to grape-accent tiles in the wine cellar off the dining room.</p>
<div id="attachment_2422" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI404_694453.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2422" alt="Antique hand made wine bottles." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI404_694453-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Antique hand made wine bottles.</p></div>
<p>The home is filled with the hand-blown Italian glass bottles Sebastiani, 73, has long fancied, along with his extensive duck decoy collection. On one wall is his certificate of knighthood from the Italian government, in recognition of his work to promote Italian grape varieties. Just across from it are his framed Boy Scout merit badges and his Eagle Scout memorabilia. Around the corner are two life-size suits of armor.</p>
<p>Surrounding the home are olive, avocado, citrus and fig trees, Italian cypress and stone pines. Wisteria, clematis and jasmine scramble over arbors and soothing lavender scents waft around the bubbling fountains. Beyond the garden is the hill where the Sebastianis hike with some of their 15 grandchildren.</p>
<p>It’s the same hill, of course, where he spent his boyhood days, when he wasn’t helping out at the family winery, hosing off floors and rolling barrels.</p>
<div id="attachment_2423" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI074_694465.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2423" alt="Old balsamic vinegar barrels in the dining room." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI074_694465-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Old balsamic vinegar barrels in the dining room.</p></div>
<p>“We lived 200 yards away,” Sebastiani recalled with a chuckle. “I was raised by the old Italians. As soon as you could stay out of trouble, they had you working. Our family code was that if you’re going to give orders, you better have done it.”</p>
<p>When he joined Sebastiani Vineyards full time in 1967, after completing an undergraduate degree and an MBA from Santa Clara University and a two-year stint in the Army, the industry had begun a radical transformation.</p>
<p>“In the 1960s, there was a small movement with a few wine writers,” Sebastiani recalled. “They wanted something to talk about, and it wasn’t jug wines. They were seeking wineries that were making wines with vintage dates and varietal designations.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI353_694462.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2424" alt="" src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI353_694462-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a>So Sebastiani Vineyards joined the Wentes of Livermore, Louis Martini in Sonoma and Napa, and a few others and began the shift away from jug wines. “If you stayed with the Burgundy, Chablis and rosé thing, you were gonna die,” he explained.</p>
<p>After his father, August, died in 1980, Sebastiani assumed the reins at the winery. His mission was to improve quality dramatically. “There was a need to be a standout, not just a player,” he said.</p>
<p>Premium grapes were key, and Sebastiani began his quest with longtime friends and grapegrowers Bob and Fred Kunde in Kenwood. “I negotiated a new contract with quality standards for each part of the ranch,” Sebastiani said. “We put quality standards on each of the varietals. I was ultimately buying every grape off the ranch.”</p>
<div id="attachment_2425" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 225px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI156_694468.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2425" alt="Coyote bronze statue in the backyard." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI156_694468-215x300.jpg" width="215" height="300"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Coyote bronze statue in the backyard.</p></div>
<p>He also grew his enology staff and bought new equipment. “We proceeded to make some awfully good wines,” he said. “In 1984 and 1985, we won more awards than any winery in America.”</p>
<p>There was friendly rivalry with other winemakers. “Bob Mondavi was one of the greatest competitors in anything he did,” Sebastiani recalled. “He and I got to be good friends because we realized there was room for both valleys and both families. Bob had a knack for surrounding himself with great people.”</p>
<p>Things came to a screeching halt when his mother, Sylvia, abruptly removed him from his position as winery president in 1985, citing concerns about expenditures that Sebastiani deemed necessary.</p>
<p>“I got word that they weren’t happy,” he said simply.</p>
<p>Departing was difficult, but creating a new winery that would embody his vision alone was a tempting alternative. After a long search to find the ideal winery site, Sebastiani and his then-wife, Vicki, opened Viansa Winery &amp; Italian Marketplace in 1989 on a Carneros hilltop south of Sonoma.</p>
<div id="attachment_2426" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI434_694466.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2426" alt="American Indian painting and antique wine bottle in the entry way of the Sebastiani home. " src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI434_694466-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">American Indian painting and antique wine bottle in the entry way of the Sebastiani home.</p></div>
<p>“I used to say at Sebastiani that I was trying to create a racehorse out of an elephant,” he explained. “At Viansa, I got to raise a colt to be a racehorse.”</p>
<p>Tapping into his heritage, Sebastiani focused on Italian grape varieties and introduced direct-to-consumer sales and a wine club, rare at the time. He also restored Viansa’s wetlands and created an acclaimed waterfowl preserve — a passion he continues today at Winemaker’s Island, his ranch in Nebraska.</p>
<p>Life was good. “It was a lot of fun,” Sebastiani said. “It didn’t hurt that Italian — quote, unquote — was popular in America. We had an elegant culture to wrap ourselves around.”</p>
<p>Around 2004, as Sebastiani prepared to retire and pass winery duties to his children, a problem arose. Consultants hired by the family said not all the children shared his vision for Viansa’s future. Ultimately, the decision was made to sell the winery.</p>
<div id="attachment_2427" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI383_694463.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2427" alt="Dining room with ceiling and wainscoting made from old redwood barrels from Sebastiani winery." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI383_694463-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dining room with ceiling and wainscoting made from old redwood barrels from the Sebastiani winery.</p></div>
<p>Walking away from a second winery, one into which he’d poured his heart and soul, was doubly bitter.</p>
<p>“You build it up and then you have to leave it. You start to believe that you’ve got a shadow following you around. If I didn’t have religion, I’d probably be sucking my thumb in a corner somewhere,” he said with a wry laugh.</p>
<p>After picking himself up, Sebastiani realized that he now had an opportunity to be free from the demands of a popular tourist stop like Viansa. “My dream was always to have a small winery where your (goal) was to make the best wine,” he said. “For the first time in my life, I was not stuck with anything. I could get my grapes anywhere.”</p>
<p>For what he calls his “swan song,” Sebastiani returned to the Kunde Ranch, now run by Bob’s son, Keith, for Chardonnay and Sangiovese grapes, and found three great spots in Amador County for Zinfandel, Primitivo and Syrah.</p>
<div id="attachment_2428" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI247_694472.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2428" alt="Sam and Robin Sebastiani walk down the old quarry road that runs through the backyard to their home." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEBASTI247_694472-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sam and Robin Sebastiani walk down the old quarry road that runs through the backyard to their home.</p></div>
<p>In collaboration with his former Viansa winemaker, Derek Irwin, Sebastiani created his line of La Chertosa wines, limited to around 1,200 cases a year. The wines are named for the monastery in Farneta, Italy, where Samuele learned the art of winemaking. It’s a respectful nod to the grandfather who walked that quarry road so long ago.</p>
<p>It’s also a fitting finale to a life well lived, one spent celebrating family and heritage. In his memento-filled home, Sebastiani is content and at peace. “I live life day to day,” he said. “I’ve stopped thinking about the future and stopped worrying about the past.”</p>

		<p>The glorious view from Daryl and Lisa Groom’s home sweeps out over downtown Healdsburg to Geyser Peak and Mount St. Helena and would be hopelessly distracting if it weren’t for the Grooms’ engaging hospitality. Conversation sparkles, food tempts, and the mood is Wine Country generosity at its most genuine.</p>
<div id="attachment_2412" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CG0525_GROOMCOOKOUT21_696010.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2412" alt="Guests play games and take in the view of the surrounding hills in Daryl and Lisa Groom's backyard." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CG0525_GROOMCOOKOUT21_696010-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Guests play games and take in the view of the surrounding hills in Daryl and Lisa Groom’s backyard.</p></div>
<p>The vista becomes merely a backdrop for this outdoor escape because the grounds are gorgeous and the goings-on at the Groom home are so much fun. A large stretch of lawn and a shimmering pool set the bucolic scene. There’s table tennis and a giant Jenga block tower made of two-by-fours. And the bocce court beckons.</p>
<p>“We like games that can be played with one hand so you can hold a glass of wine in the other,” Daryl said, showing his affinity for good times and his respect for his profession, as he is one of California’s most acclaimed winemakers.</p>
<p>The Grooms bought this treasure of a property 16 years ago in a private sale, one of the upsides of being as plugged into the community as they are.</p>
<p>“Since we were lucky enough to buy this place, we feel we have to share it,” Lisa explained, and Daryl agreed. “People just fall in love with it, and we love sharing it with other people.”</p>
<p>The property is especially stunning in fall, arguably Wine Country’s finest season for outdoor entertaining; the landscape is ablaze with color, the fleeting light of early evening soft and enfolding.</p>
<p>The home sits on 7 acres on a hill off Dry Creek Road and includes a frequently used tennis court, organic garden, small orchard and chicken coop. There’s even a yesteryear clothesline tucked amid rose bushes and fruit trees.</p>
<div id="attachment_2413" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CG0525_GROOMCOOKOUT09_696001.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2413" alt="A working Cadillac nicknamed Colby Red serves as a backdrop." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CG0525_GROOMCOOKOUT09_696001-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A working Cadillac nicknamed Colby Red serves as a backdrop.</p></div>
<p>A 1949 black Cadillac was included in the sale of the house, and it has served as bride-and-groom transport for two couples, friends of the Grooms who were lucky enough to have their weddings at the home.</p>
<p>The first thing the Grooms did was put in a pool and build a 600-square-foot guesthouse, because they often have family visit from their native Australia and dinner guests sometimes spend the night.</p>
<p>The guesthouse is flanked by a commanding outdoor stone fireplace that the Grooms use year-round, especially as the last days of summer turn to fall. “When our children have friends over, it’s the natural gathering place for conversation,” Lisa said. She keeps s’mores ingredients on hand for such occasions.</p>
<p>The roof of the guesthouse extends over the fireplace and an alfresco dining area with a long, welcoming table that is surrounded by a low rock wall. Off to its side is an outdoor kitchen on a deck built by Lisa’s father. The granite-topped kitchen holds a sink, under-counter refrigerator, two gas burners and a built-in DCS grill. There is also a freestanding Weber kettle-style barbecue.</p>
<p>The original house was one story, 1970s-style. Once the outdoor space was spiffed up, the Grooms remodeled, adding a second story and creating 4,000 square feet where they’ve raised their four children — Lauren, 26, Meg, 24, and Kara, 22, who are now off on their own, and Colby, 16, who attends Santa Rosa’s Cardinal Newman High School.</p>
<p>In addition to an up-to-the-minute kitchen with an ample island and high-end appliances, there is a utility room that houses a washer and dryer at one end and a long stretch of counter space at the other. The counter is home to Lisa’s dehydrator and an ice cream maker, and also serves as something like a catering area when they host guests.</p>
<p>The Grooms worked with Gerda Engelbart of Healdsburg when they remodeled, and the landscape plan is credited to Up &amp; Up Landscape in Sebastopol. Colby raises market lambs on the property, keeping a pair in a small shed with a pen.</p>
<p>Daryl and Lisa met when he was a winemaker at Australia’s most famous winery, Penfolds, in the Barossa Valley, and where she was a production assistant. They were a youngish married couple in 1989 when Penfolds purchased 50 percent of Geyser Peak Winery in Geyserville and installed Daryl as winemaker, moving the Grooms to the U.S. What they thought would be a stay of a few years turned out to be permanent, although their connection to Australia remains strong.</p>
<p>In 1997, partnering with Jeanette and David Marschall, Lisa’s sister and brother-in-law in Australia, they bought 87 acres in Barossa Valley, planted Shiraz and Zinfandel, and launched Groom Wines. Daryl is the winemaker, spending a good deal of time in Australia, and the Grooms market the wines in the U.S. from their home office.</p>
<div id="attachment_2414" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CG0525_GROOMCOOKOUT24_696019.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2414" alt="Daryl and Lisa set the table and serve food for guests." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CG0525_GROOMCOOKOUT24_696019-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Daryl and Lisa set the table and serve food for guests.</p></div>
<p>Asked if they do the cooking themselves, they answer “Yes!” in unison. Lisa does the shopping, prep work and inside cooking, and Daryl mans the grills. Lisa is a passionate gardener and beekeeper, and plans menus based on what’s fresh and homemade.</p>
<p>At a dinner for 14, Daryl grilled seven racks of lamb slathered with Lisa’s estate-grown blackberry sauce, and roasted potatoes and rosemary from the garden. The meal began with house-made fresh goat cheese with honey from Lisa’s hives. For dessert, there were three sorbets, strawberry elderflower, triple orange and lemon tequila, made with fruit grown on the property and accompanied by Lisa’s honey-basil shortbread.</p>
<p>She plants directly in the ground, dealing with gophers as best she can, saying that when she has her hands in the earth, she feels a cathartic connection to her mother and grandmother, who avidly gardened before her in Australia. Her garden includes a variety of squashes, melons, eggplant, strawberries, raspberries and peppers.</p>
<p>Lisa loves tomatoes, from which she makes “to-mah-to” jam. She currently has Red Brandywine, Green Zebra and Black Russian, among others varieties. “I grow San Marzano for sauce and canning, always an Early Girl for reliability, and a selection of heirlooms, which are more finicky to grow but the fruit is outstanding,” she explained.</p>
<div id="attachment_2415" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CG0525_GROOMCOOKOUT08_696000.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2415" alt="Homemade chevre along with freshly picked cherries." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CG0525_GROOMCOOKOUT08_696000-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Homemade chevre along with freshly picked cherries.</p></div>
<p>Lisa washes her garden harvest outside in an antique vessel that sits atop an ancient stone fencepost, which drains right back into the ground. She also nurtures abundant greenish-white hydrangeas that were on the property when the Grooms arrived and honor their link to the home’s history.</p>
<p>After Daryl’s storied career at Geyser Peak, and in addition to the Shiraz, Sauvignon Blanc and Zinfandel he makes for Groom Wines, he added an important element to his resume: Colby Red.</p>
<p>Colby Groom was born with a heart condition and has endured two open-heart surgeries and long recovery times.</p>
<p>He was so thankful for the good care he received that he asked his dad to make a wine that could be used as a fundraiser for heart-health charities. Daryl began producing Colby Red in 2011 with an original goal of donating $100,000. The wine has since raised more than $500,000, and the new goal is $1 million.</p>
<p>As brand spokesperson, Colby has been on the “Today” show and many local TV stations, with speaking engagements across the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p>Daryl and Lisa love it when their children bring their friends home, and everyone gathers around the outside table to share their lives. A 1950s-style jukebox in the guesthouse has outdoor speakers, often blaring, and the rock wall is a favorite spot for dancing. It’s a place full of love and laughter, and the Grooms wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>

		<p>An avid ballet dancer into her late teens, Gerda Engelbart still finds a parallel between that fluid use of space on stage and her building-design work today.</p>
<p>“People have a relationship to space even if they’re not aware of it,” she said.</p>
<p>Whether designing the interior of Diavola Pizzeria &amp; Salumeria in Geyserville or repurposing wood from a former boarding house in Healdsburg, her instincts in working with her clients are to “help them think of ideas that they never would have thought of on their own.”</p>
<p>From her father, Douglas Engelbart, inventor of the computer mouse, she learned to “break up the box and think outside the box.” From her mother, Ballard, she gained an appreciation for landscape design.</p>
<p>Yet she’s just as willing to redesign a Windsor tract home for a family outgrowing its living space. No matter the scale of the project, “listening is key,” she said. “The word ‘drafting’ or ‘drawing’ means to ‘pull forth,’ like you pull a draft beer or a draft horse pulls the plow. That’s what I’m doing with each client.”</p>
<p><strong>Then:</strong> Born in Berkeley and raised in a Joseph Eichler-built house in Palo Alto in the 1960s.</p>
<p><strong>Now:</strong> Lives in a 1930s cabin in Healdsburg, with vaulted ceilings and high windows. “I like to call it my mini-Maybeck,” she said, referring to Arts-and-Crafts-style architect Bernard Maybeck.</p>
<p><strong>Studied architecture:</strong> California College of the Arts in San Francisco</p>
<p><strong>Age:</strong> 60</p>
<p><strong>Favorite analogy:</strong> “Rembrandt and Van Gogh are both great painters and the elements of design exist in all of their works; that’s what makes them great. But they’re completely different styles and it’s a personal choice about which one you like.”</p>
<p><strong>Sense of discovery:</strong> “A lot of these old houses have beautiful fir underneath the floor and people don’t realize that it can be sanded.”</p>
<p><strong>To unwind:</strong> Camping and long walks with her dog, Odin, a Belgian Malinois mix.</p>
<p><strong>Guilty pleasure: </strong>“Way too much Sudoku.”</p>
<p><strong>Latest project:</strong> A “very modern structure” in Dry Creek Valley for an artist who creates large-scale paintings and needs both living space and room in which to paint and exhibit her work.</p>

		<p>Everyone seems to want to be in Wine Country during harvest, the most exciting and beautiful time of the year. There’s a buoyant energy at wineries now, as well as new tasting experiences and tours, many of which take place in the middle of the crush action. Wine writer Virginie Boone recommends these wineries for late summer and fall visits; they are open to the public, typically from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Contact the individual tasting room to confirm.</p>
<p><strong>Anaba, 60 Bonneau Road, Sonoma, 707-996-4188,</strong> <a href="http://anabawines.com" target="_blank">anabawines.com</a>. In the heart of windy Carneros, Anaba welcomes tasters to enjoy its restored farmhouse and remarkable Rhone-variety wines, in addition to vineyard-designated Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays. A good spot for picnics, Anaba offers a wine education experience called Beyond the Label, during which each of its wines is explored in detail; there is also a Salon Tasting of flights of wines.</p>
<p><strong>Benziger Family Winery, 1883 London Ranch Road, Glen Ellen, 707-935-4527,</strong> benziger.com.

The cost is $50 per person, and the experience happens daily at 10:30 a.m. and 2 p.m.; advance reservations are required</p>
<p><strong>Black Stallion Winery, 4089 Silverado Trail, Napa, 707-227-3250,</strong> <a href="http://blackstallionwinery.com" target="_blank">blackstallionwinery.com</a>.

Charles Krug, where Peter and Robert Mondavi got their winemaking start, remains an impressive blend of old and new, and its epic Redwood Cellar is an airy place to taste.

The visitor experience at DeLoach is always a good one, but owner Jean-Charles Boisset can’t help but continue to up the ante, accentuating the celebration of nature here and the bounty of Biodynamic farming, as he has done at Raymond Vineyards in Napa Valley. This time of year, take part in the MFS Blending Experience, a chance to play with Pinot Noir; it’s offered daily by appointment, at 10:30 a.m. or 1:30 p.m.</p>

<p><strong>Hamel Family Wines, 15401 Sonoma Highway, Sonoma, 707-996-5800,</strong> <a href="http://hamelfamilywines.com" target="_blank">hamelfamilywines.com</a>.

Situated in one of the oldest stone buildings in Napa Valley, Markham makes a wide range of wines and offers a taste of four (Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon) in its daily Rock &amp; Roll Tasting ($15). The on-site art gallery features the work of music photographer Baron Wolman, with lots of shots from Woodstock and the time he spent shooting for Rolling Stone magazine.</p>
<p><strong>Monticello Vineyards, 4242 Big Ranch Road, Napa, 707-253-2802,</strong> <a href="http://corleyfamilynapavalley.com" target="_blank">corleyfamilynapavalley.com</a>.

Tours into the vineyard are led twice a day, by appointment.</p>

<p><strong>Patz &amp; Hall’s Sonoma House, 21200 Eighth St. East, Sonoma, 877-265-6700,</strong> <a href="http://patzhall.com" target="_blank">patzhall.com</a>.

		<p><strong>Baci Cafe &amp; Wine Bar, 336 Healdsburg Ave., Healdsburg, 707-433-8111,</strong> <a href="http://bacicafeandwinebar.com" target="_blank">bacicafeandwinebar.com</a>. Classic Italian dishes, many of them from the northern part of Italy, are expertly prepared by Shari Sarabi, who is originally from Iran but cooks as though he’s from Milan. A large wood-fired oven turns out some of the best pizza in Sonoma County. The sauce Bolognese is the real thing, and there’s tiramisu and panna cotta for dessert. The wine list features wines from Italy and from around Healdsburg. Reviewed 12/1/13. $$$</p>
<p><strong>Backyard, 6566 Front St., Forestville, 707-820-8445,</strong> <a href="http://backyardforestville.com" target="_blank">backyardforestville.com</a>. The farmers, ranchers and/or fisherfolk who produce just about every ingredient in every item on the menu are listed by name, and they’re almost all from Sonoma County, and right around Forestville. This is great in-season, locally produced food, ably handled in the kitchen. The wines are local, too. When the place fills up, it gets loud, and the service can be spotty, but the good locavore cooking helps smooth the rough spots. Reviewed 12/9/12. $$-$$$</p>

Belly raises the bar for gastropubs in the North Bay, with wonderfully flavorful renditions of staples such as pizza, burgers, steak, barbecued pulled pork, crab cakes, salads and more. Chef Gray Rollin has been tour chef for many popular music acts, and you can imagine band members appreciating his way with comfort food. Two dozen beers on tap and 26 more by the bottle present extensive choices for ways to wet and whet your whistle. Reviewed 4/28/13. $-$$</p>
<p><strong>Bravas Bar de Tapas, 420 Center St., Healdsburg, 707-433-7700,</strong> <a href="http://starkrestaurants.com" target="_blank">starkrestaurants.com</a>. Owners Mark and Terri Stark traveled to Spain and fell in love with the wine-loving, snack-munching, pal-schmoozing culture of the tapas bar scene there. So they brought it back home to join their four other Sonoma County restaurants. The backyard of the pre-war house that’s home to Bravas is transformed into an alfresco venue for tapas-style conviviality. The snacks are extraordinarily diverse and delicious. Scads of Spanish and local wines and sangrias await. Reviewed 12/16/12. $$-$$$$</p>
<p><strong>Café Citti, 9049 Sonoma Highway, Kenwood, 707-833-2690,</strong> <a href="http://cafecitti.com" target="_blank">cafecitti.com</a>. Luca and Linda Citti found the key to success when they started their trattoria in Kenwood a couple decades ago: forget fancy trappings and serve really good Italian food at reasonable prices. It worked and Café Citti has been thrilling taste buds ever since. The basics — lasagna, tortellini or ravioli in brodo, rotisserie chicken, cannoli, tiramisu — are all here and done beautifully. It’s the kind of hole in the wall that visitors to Italy write home about. Reviewed 10/28/12. $$.</p>
<p><strong>Canneti Roadhouse, 6675 Front St., Forestville, 707-887-2232,</strong> <a href="http://cannetirestaurant.com" target="_blank">cannetirestaurant.com</a>. Canneti Roadhouse primarily serves Tuscan food that chef and owner Francesco Torre learned to love as a child in Italy. That means a local version of the Mediterranean diet, with lots of fresh vegetables, olive oil, bread and meat (especially game). A four-course seasonal tasting menu is a good bet, and each course can be paired with wine. During clement weather, there’s alfresco dining out back. Reviewed 5/26/13. $$$-$$$$</p>
<p><strong>Chef Patrick’s, 16337 Main St., Guerneville, 707-869-9161,</strong> <a href="http://chefpatricks.com" target="_blank">chefpatricks.com</a>. Although the food is billed as California-French, it also includes lots of Italian dishes. And since Chef Patrick is Vietnamese, there’s a Southeast Asian accent to some of his cooking. His many influences do not result in chaos, but rather in a refined cuisine that includes fish, fowl and beefy favorites. He likes to amp up the flavor profile of popular dishes like beef ragu, which is all to the good. Reviewed 2/10/13. $$-$$$</p>

Chef and owner Dino Bugica spent years learning about real Italian food from his real Italian family and by living and working in Italy. It shows in his house-made salamis, authentic pizzas, pasta dishes, entrees and desserts. The salami and cheese appetizer is not to be missed. Diavola is a magnet for food lovers to sleepy, out-of-the-way Geyserville, and deservedly so. Reviewed 5/11/14. $$-$$$$</p>
<p><strong>Dry Creek Kitchen, 317 Healdsburg Ave., Healdsburg, 707-431-0330,</strong> <a href="http://charliepalmer.com" target="_blank">charliepalmer.com</a>. This is Healdsburg’s classiest restaurant and one of its best. The cooking is international-Californian, meaning lots of fresh local ingredients handled with sophistication, such as scallops en croute with a black truffle sauce, and house-smoked Liberty duck breast with a confit of duck leg meat and pork belly joining it on the plate. The pastry chef does excellent work with intricate delicacies. There’s a wine list of more than 500 wines, all of them from Sonoma County, and there is no corkage fee if you bring a Sonoma County wine of your own. All this glamour is not inexpensive, so be prepared.<br>

<p><strong>Flavor Bistro, 96 Old Courthouse Square, Santa Rosa, 707-573-9600,</strong> <a href="http://flavorbistro.com" target="_blank">flavorbistro.com</a>. In its friendly, unpretentious way, Flavor Bistro is a shining example of Sonoma County’s enviable food scene. There is a great wine list, house-made pastas and pizzas, meats and vegetables from local organic farms, breakfast most days and lunch and dinner every day, and best of all, modest prices on most dishes. All this makes Flavor the go-to place for locals (and wise visitors). Reviewed 12/8/13. $-$$$$</p>
<p><strong>Forchetta/Bastoni, 6948 Sebastopol Ave., Sebastopol, 707-829-9500,</strong> <a href="http://forchettabastoni.com" target="_blank">forchettabastoni.com</a>. This review focuses on Bastoni, which serves Southeast Asian street food, with lots of noodles, chicken and rice with spicy hot sauce, salads, curries, and of course, a very good banh mi sandwich. Prices are moderate and there’s lots from which to choose. The full bar is one of Sebastopol’s top spots for get-togethers and friendly fun.<br>

The food has never been better at this successful restaurant since proprietor Sondra Bernstein and executive chef John Toulze expanded their repertoire during world travels. The wines are all from Rhone grape varieties from the U.S., France and Spain. The full-flavored menu goes perfectly with the French country theme. Duck confit, steak frites, wild flounder meuniere, pastis-scented mussels — there’s so much to like. Reviewed 2/17/13. $$-$$$</p>
<p><strong>Il Posto, 4211 Solano Ave., Napa, 707-251-8600,</strong> <a href="http://ilpostonapa.com" target="_blank">ilpostonapa.com</a>. An excellent neighborhood restaurant that has the best characteristics of all good Italian places: The pastas are made from scratch, care is taken to respect the ingredients, and the food appeals to folks of all ages. There’s pizza, of course, and it’s good, especially with the house-made sausage on top. A big wine list enhances classic chicken and veal dishes, cioppino and great desserts.

Jack and Tony’s has the best whisky bar in the North Bay, with more than 300 selections from around the world, from rough to smooth, cheap to very expensive, and with nuances to satisfy any palate. The restaurant serves crowd-pleasing dishes such as steaks, grilled ahi tuna, sage-stuffed roasted chicken and braised lamb shank. Do not miss the butterscotch pudding, which is made with real Scotch and butter. Reviewed 1/13/13. $$$-$$$$</p>
<p><strong>John Ash &amp; Co., 4330 Barnes Road, Santa Rosa, 707-527-7687,</strong> <a href="http://vintnersinn.com" target="_blank">vintnersinn.com</a>. John Ash &amp; Co. remains the most soigné restaurant in Sonoma County, and the Pat Kuleto-designed “Front Room” is the comfiest watering hole imaginable. Chef Thomas Schmidt keeps the restaurant’s reputation for fine food burnished bright, using fresh, local and seasonal ingredients whenever possible. After all, it was this place that invented Wine Country cuisine. It’s perfect for celebrations of any kind. Reviewed 2/3/13. $$$-$$$$</p>
<p><strong>Monti’s Rotisserie &amp; Bar, 714 Village Court, Montgomery Village, Santa Rosa, 707-568-4404,</strong> <a href="http://starkrestaurants.com" target="_blank">starkrestaurants.com</a>. A centrally located site in Montgomery Village makes Monti’s a fine choice for lunches, after-work get-togethers and dinners, when the wood-fired rotisserie is lit and turns out specials of the day, including roast leg of lamb, baby back ribs, prime rib, Liberty duck and veal roast. The restaurant includes an oyster and seafood bar, pizzas, salads, pastas and a long list of specialty drinks mixed by the gregarious bar staff. Reviewed 2/12/12. $$$-$$$$.</p>

Glen Ellen’s reputation as a stop for fine restaurants got a huge boost when Catherine Venturini and John Burdick opened Olive &amp; Vine in Jack London Village. She and her chef de cuisine, Julie Warner, do an exceptional job exalting local and organic ingredients in their versions of Sonoma cuisine.

This small but mighty Indian restaurant occupies a nondescript corner of the Mission Circle Shopping Center, but the food is anything but nondescript. It’s full-on Indian and Kashmiri cooking, with lamb, chicken, and vegetable curries; a signature dish of lamb in an apricot and coconut sauce; marinated and flash-cooked tandoori chicken; house-made yogurt drinks; perfect creamed spinach and soft cheese; and much more.

Here’s your big-time casino-style steakhouse. Your 42-ounce prime T-bone for two is $120, your own 20-ounce rib-eye is $54, and filet mignons start at $43 for the “petite.” The meat is as terrific as the prices, and the kitchen also serves up chicken and seafood, like the 28-ounce Northern Australian lobster tail for $149.

There are also three “tastings” that include a cheese and wine pairing for $25, a five-course vegetarian food and wine tasting for $35, and a five-course chef’s tasting that culminates with K-J’s Trace Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon paired with seasonal meats such as lamb loin.

The main feature of Riccardo’s is the long bar where Bennett Valley-ites like to meet and chat.

The restaurant, called “Rustic, Francis’s Favorites,” features the Italian foods of his childhood, plus adult loves such as an Argentine grill serving big portions of beef with chimichurri sauce. The wine list is mostly from Coppola’s winery, and that’s OK. A wood-burning oven makes wonderful pizzas.<br>

<p><strong>Shige Sushi Japanese Kitchen, 8235 Old Redwood Highway, Cotati, 707-795-9753,</strong> <a href="http://shige-sushi.com" target="_blank">shige-sushi.com</a>. A small but cozy room in the heart of Cotati has a big surprise for lovers of Japanese food. The appetizers alone are worth the trip — albacore with thin rounds of jalapeño peppers, poke salad, fried chicken karaage — and much more, all well-prepared by chef Shigekazu Mori.

<p><strong>Terrapin Creek, 1580 Eastshore Road, Bodega Bay, 707-875-2700,</strong> <a href="http://terrapincreekcafe.com" target="_blank">terrapincreekcafe.com</a>. Owners Andrew Truong and Liya Lin have fashioned one of the most charming restaurants in Wine Country, and the cooking is a shining example of locally sourced ingredients used in refined and thoughtful dishes that never fail to please. Simple soups and salads come to life. Entrees are rich and bold, such as lamb sugo over pappardelle and glazed baby back ribs. The cooking is pure Californian with a hint of French and Asian. Highly recommended. Reviewed 3/24/13. $$$$</p>
<p><strong>Wild Goat Bistro, 6 Petaluma Blvd. N., Petaluma, 707-658-1156,</strong> <a href="http://wildgoatbistro.com" target="_blank">wildgoatbistro.com</a>. This small bistro tucked in the back of the Great Petaluma Mill specializes in Neapolitan-style pizza, and that means perfectly made and with crackling thin crusts. But there’s lots more to like, mostly dishes with an Italian flair, including local lamb ragu over pappardelle. The salads are organic, the foods made locally by artisans, and the meats are nitrate-free. A good wine list helps out. Reviewed 3/3/13. $$-$$$</p>
<p><strong>Woodfour Brewing Company, 6780 Depot Street, Sebastopol, 707-823-3144,</strong> <a href="http://woodfourbrewing.com" target="_blank">woodfourbrewing.com</a>. Just what you want in a restaurant: something new and different. The brewery in The Barlow center makes a range of unique beers and ales, and has a cupboard full of bottled beers from all over the world. The food is as ingenious as the beers and beautifully displayed on the plates. It shows great creativity on the part of the chefs as they turn unlikely ingredients into exceptionally delicious dishes. Reviewed 9/8/13. $$</p>

		<p>Move over, nachos and chicken wings. Local gastropubs are redefining what it means to belly up to the bar and grab a bite.</p>
<p>Taking their cues from award-winning craft brews made on-site or close by, local chefs are elevating beer and food pairings to a new level with carefully curated menus that highlight both the brews and the food.</p>
<div id="attachment_2391" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 209px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CC0303_BEER_CHEESESOUP_552644.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2391" alt="Beer and cheese soup with Hopmonk Tavern Ale." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CC0303_BEER_CHEESESOUP_552644-199x300.jpg" width="199" height="300"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Beer and cheese soup with Hopmonk Tavern Ale.</p></div>
<p>Jamil Peden of Woodfour Brewing Co. in Sebastopol’s Barlow center is one of a new breed of Michelin-star-worthy chefs whose dishes are a mix of haute and hearty, backed by beer. Bar snacks include green-garlic potato chips, pickled sardines with beet tartare, homemade pickles, and deviled eggs with horseradish and paprika, which work beautifully with the sour farmhouse and stout ales produced at Woodfour.</p>
<p>Typical pub fare like fish and chips gets a makeover with lager-battering, parsnips, crab and fennel; there is pork schnitzel with spaetzle, and a dreamy cassoulet with heirloom beans and truffles, paired with Woodfour’s Imperial Black Ale or lighter Berliner Weisse.</p>
<p>Common in Europe, gastropubs typically serve high-quality food alongside high-quality beer. Some local establishments, including Woodfour and stalwart Dempsey’s in Petaluma, brew their own beers. Barley and Hops Tavern in Occidental offers an eclectic menu of draft and bottled beers from top producers to complement its California halibut with fingerling potatoes, and Niman Ranch beef burger with mango salsa and brie.</p>
<p>Gastropubs likely won’t satisfy those seeking the simplicity of a pitcher of Bud Light and a bucket of Buffalo wings, but, thankfully, they’re here for the rest of us.</p>

		<p>It looks a bit like organized chaos as riders prepare for Levi’s GranFondo in Santa Rosa.</p>
<p>Climbing long, steep roads and barreling down exhilarating descents, a sea of cyclists will wash over western Sonoma on Oct. 4, riding in Levi’s GranFondo, an event that underscores the area’s exploding cycling scene.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/KP0929_619189.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2378" alt="" src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/KP0929_619189-257x300.jpg" width="257" height="300"></a>The GranFondo (“big race” in Italian), celebrating its sixth year, draws 7,500 riders from all over the world for what has become one of the premier cycling events in the U.S. The brainchild of Santa Rosa’s Levi Leipheimer, a decorated former pro cyclist who was among the world’s elite, the event is a spectacle that draws both professionals and amateurs who ride side by side on the traffic-controlled course, hailed as one of the most beautiful and challenging in the country.</p>
<p>Just don’t call it a race.</p>
<p>Sure, riders are timed. And yes, all participants are launched in a mass start at Santa Rosa’s Finley Center, giving everyone a seriously peloton-like experience for the first 20 miles. But there are no prizes for crossing the line first; the reward is in the doing, fundraising for mostly local charities (nearly $1.2 million since 2009) and a great after-party.</p>
<p>GranFondo has three routes: the family-friendly, 30-mile Piccolo; 60-mile Medio; and the big daddy, the 103-mile Gran route. The Gran, with its 9,000 feet of climbing, is a lung- and leg-scorching roller coaster covering some of Sonoma’s most remote and gorgeous roads. Four thousand riders on this route are expected to emerge from the redwoods of Cazadero, climb King Ridge Road, and make their way to Highway 1 and the ocean, before one last climb up Coleman Valley Road and their return to the Finley Center.</p>
<p>There, an all-day festival greets GranFondo riders and any other interested revelers, with restorative carbs (beer), locally grown grub, live music and activities for kids. There is no admission charge for the festival.</p>
<p>A spot in the Gran ride costs $160, the Medio $140 and the Piccolo $80. The ride sells out every year, so sign up soon.</p>

		<p>Fifty years ago, an ambitious magazine reporter and his pregnant wife moved into a small ranch house just north of Glen Ellen. Hunter S. Thompson hadn’t yet changed the face of modern journalism — but he was about to.</p>
<div id="attachment_2366" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Hunter-S-Thompson.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2366" alt="(from the Everett Collection)" src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Hunter-S-Thompson-300x258.jpg" width="300" height="258"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A young Hunter S. Thompson in his signature shades. (from the Everett Collection)</p></div>
<p>The road trip west from Colorado to California was miserable. The young writer and his new wife rattled over two-lane blacktop on a 1,100-mile journey, through “rotten snow” and baking deserts, driving an old Rambler pulling a trailer. He had little money. She was eight months pregnant. And when they finally pulled into the redneck hamlet of Glen Ellen, the owner of the house they had arranged to rent told them, bluntly, that it was no longer available.</p>
<p>Hunter S. Thompson had arrived in Sonoma County.</p>
<p>In early February 1964, Thompson was not yet the literary bottle rocket whose freewheeling “gonzo” style of reporting and writing in books including “Hell’s Angels” and “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” would help change modern journalism. He was struggling, broke, and left his home in Woody Creek, Colo., with his wife, Sandy, to further his career as a magazine reporter.</p>
<p>San Francisco was just 50 miles from Glen Ellen, and he planned to earn money writing articles on the American West for The National Reporter and National Observer. The Berkeley Free Speech<br>
Movement was in its early days, the Republican National Convention was coming to San Francisco that summer, and the area was buzzing with colorful ideas and subjects. “There’s too much fresh stuff out here,” he wrote. “I am near the action or at least near enough.”</p>
<div id="attachment_2367" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/HSTGLENELLEN_697497.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2367" alt="(courtesy of Archie Horton)" src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/HSTGLENELLEN_697497-300x201.jpg" width="300" height="201"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A photocopy of an old photograph of Glen Ellen’s Rustic Inn, exact date unknown. (courtesy of Archie Horton)</p></div>
<p>As for his inauspicious arrival in Glen Ellen, “I arrived pulling my trailer and was denied entrance to the house I was planning to live in,” Thompson recalled. “The fellow had changed his mind.”</p>
<p>The couple found another place nearby, a small ranch house at 9400 Bennett Valley Road. It wasn’t much, but it was home. “I live in a sort of Okie shack, paying a savage rent, and spend most of my day in a deep ugly funk, plotting vengeance,” he wrote to a friend.</p>
<p>Today, the cozy town of Glen Ellen — the downtown has two bends in the road, a small bridge, upscale restaurants and an art gallery — is a quaint gathering spot for visitors to world-class wineries and Jack London State Park. In 1964, it was very different. Gene McGarr, a hard-drinking visitor from the Bronx, described Glen Ellen as “a rural slum.” Everywhere were horses, cows, chickens and old shacks with broken-down trucks tangled in tall grass. The place reeked of manure. Thompson called his new home “the Brazil of America, the land of cheap wine and the 10-cent cantaloupe.” Glen Ellen, he noted forlornly, was merely “Tulsa with a view.”</p>
<p>The Thompsons slept on a mattress and box springs on the floor of their place, and scoured flea markets and secondhand stores for furnishings. He made a desk out of an old door. He called his new home Owl House, perhaps in tribute to Jack London’s Wolf House, whose burned-out ruins were just a few miles away.</p>

<p>On March 24, Sandy gave birth to Juan Fitzgerald Thompson, at Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital. The boy’s name reflected his father’s love for the writer F. Scott Fitzgerald and recently slain President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Thompson dashed off a letter to his boyhood friend, Paul Semonin, with a mix of personal excitement and professional trepidation. It said: “I have a son named Juan. Ten days old. Not a cent in the house and no cents coming in. I am seriously considering work as a laborer. … I am deep in the grips of a professional collapse that worries me to the extent that I cannot do any work to cure it.”</p>
<p>Thompson’s residency in Sonoma County was a period of hard work and intense self-doubt. A year before, he had been a jaunty journalist, reporting from Puerto Rico and South America, finding his voice as a writer. He stayed up late, drinking rum cocktails and loudly debating others about politics. He was a drifter, young and on the road, and his world was filled with adventure, romance and opportunity.</p>
<div id="attachment_2369" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/HSTGLENELLEN_697506.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2369" alt="The small ranch house where Hunter S.

Thompson lived with his wife and infant son during their short stay in Glen Ellen was at 9400 Bennett Valley Road.</p></div>
<p>In 1964, life was quite different. Now Thompson was a man with responsibilities. He was in a strange place with a young wife and new baby, a dying car, a skittish Doberman named Agar and no cash. “It is now a year since I got back from South America, my wallet full of money and my future full of fat leads,” he wrote to Semonin in late April. “But the year has been a bust; for some reason I can’t speak the language here. I am not with it. For the past two months I have been in a black bog of depression, fathering a son, living among people more vicious than I ever thought existed, and bouncing from one midnight to the next in a blaze of stupid drunkenness.”</p>
<p>Thompson was about to turn 27, a date by which time he had always figured he’d be dead.</p>
<p>As a freelancer, Thompson hustled for assignments. For the National Observer, which paid him about $200 an article, he often penned book reviews and lightweight color pieces. “The Observer is decent, but I often wonder about their motives,” he wrote. “I detect a trend in their acceptance of frothy pieces and disinterest in meaty ones.” Thompson reported on the waning beatnik scene in San Francisco’s North Beach neighborhood, as well as an awakening student protest movement in Montana, a Scottish gathering and games in Santa Rosa, and even a piece about Marlon Brando’s futile attempt to help local Indians regain fishing rights in Olympia, Wash.</p>
<p>He traveled to Ketchum, Idaho, to investigate the reasons for Ernest Hemingway’s suicide there three years earlier. Like many writers of his generation, Thompson loved Hemingway; he would sometimes retype “The Sun Also Rises”&nbsp;and&nbsp;“A Farewell to Arms,”&nbsp;not changing a word, in order to understand the rhythm of Hemingway’s language. The resulting “What Lured Hemingway to Ketchum?” story for the Observer was one of his finest pieces.</p>
<p>Thompson’s analysis of Hemingway’s waning powers in his final years shows signs of self-reflection: “The function of art is to bring order out of chaos, a tall order when the chaos is static and a superhuman task when chaos is multiplying.” Before leaving Ketchum, Thompson stole a pair of elk antlers hanging above the front door of Hemingway’s cabin.</p>
<p>Despite the range of assignments, Hunter felt isolated in Glen Ellen. “I am in the same condition here as in Woody Creek, only in less colorful and pleasant surroundings,” he wrote to novelist William J. Kennedy. “I have no conversations except on chance meetings in San Francisco. Once a month at best. My only hope is to make enough money to get to New York at once and run out my mouth to the detriment of the populace.” He managed to secure an office in the San Francisco bureau of the Wall Street Journal. “I would wander in on off-hours and obviously on drugs and ask for my messages,” Thompson recalled. “They liked me but I was like a bull in the china shop.”</p>
<p>To cure his boredom, after dark he would poach deer in the woods behind Owl House. When Agar flushed the animal out of the brush, Thompson would attempt to bring it down with his .357 Magnum pistol, firing into the dark.</p>
<p>Thompson also began to develop an unconventional and energetic style of writing that mixed fiction with factual reporting, a style he later dubbed “gonzo” journalism. “Fiction is a bridge to the truth that journalism can’t reach,” he wrote to book editor Angus Cameron in 1965. “Facts are lies when they are added up.” Thompson’s approach, which he called “impressionistic journalism,” involved injecting himself as a participant into the events of the narrative. A mad rush of words and images, as well as added metaphoric elements, created a swirl of facts and fiction, deliberately blurred.</p>
<p>It was fresh and groundbreaking, well suited to documenting the hypocritical and degenerate aspects of American society.</p>
<p>Novelist Tom Wolfe described Thompson’s style as “part journalism and part personal memoir admixed with powers of wild invention, and wilder rhetoric inspired by the bizarre exuberance of a young civilization.” Wolfe called Thompson “the century’s greatest comic writer in the English language.”</p>
<p>Four months after arriving in Glen Ellen, however, Thompson was desperate; he even pawned his belongings (including some of his beloved guns) to make rent. Feeling at the end of the road as a journalist, he sent a letter to President Lyndon Johnson (probably facetiously) offering his services as the next governor of American Samoa.</p>
<p>“I have a need for an orderly existence in a pacific place, in order to complete a novel of overwhelming importance to the sanity of this era,” he wrote, on stationery from the Holiday Inn in Pierre, S.D. Two weeks later, White House Special Assistant Larry O’Brien answered, noting that Thompson’s offer would be “given every consideration.” Elated, Thompson went to Brooks Brothers and purchased several white linen suits befitting a future governor. “When can we get with it?” he wrote back to the White House. “I am eager to be off. … Haste will benefit us all.” No more was heard from LBJ’s office.</p>
<p>In August 1964, Republicans descended on San Francisco for the Republican National Convention at the Cow Palace. Barry Goldwater, the ultraconservative senator from Arizona, headed the party’s ticket and made his famous vow to the delegates: “Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.” Thompson covered the convention for the National Observer, and recalled feeling afraid that he was the only person in the building not loudly applauding.</p>
<p>While there, Thompson was heard on the telephone brutally swearing at a representative of AT&amp;T, who had threatened to turn off his phone in Glen Ellen for nonpayment of bills. The editors sent Thompson a letter of reprimand: If he was going to represent their paper, he had to get his act together.</p>
<p>After hours, Thompson began hanging around an old bar called the Rustic Inn in downtown Glen Ellen. Built in 1876, the Rustic was the last of the original 11 bars that once lined Arnold Drive. It was destroyed in a 1974 fire, but for many years the Rustic’s owners did a tidy business by selling the myth that the place was Jack London’s favorite watering hole. To Thompson, the Rustic was a roughneck retreat plying on gullible tourists. Even locals were wary of the place.</p>
<div id="attachment_2370" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/HSTGLENELLEN_697488.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2370" alt="Bar patrons Jen and Mike Mettler, tourists visiting from Clements, California, drinking beer under an image of Jack London at the Jack London Saloon in Glen Ellen." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/HSTGLENELLEN_697488-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bar patrons Jen and Mike Mettler, tourists visiting from Clements, California, drinking beer under an image of Jack London at the Jack London Saloon in Glen Ellen.</p></div>
<p>Thompson drafted a piece called “The Rustic Inn &amp; Jack London &amp; The Valley of the Moon” and submitted it to several publications. “It’s a pure color job, but a good one,” he clucked to an editor.</p>
<p>“The 1890s atmosphere is badly addled by 1960-style hoodlums who long for trouble,” he wrote. “On most weekend nights the place fills up with one of the sleaziest mobs in all Christendom. Along with the regular handful of pot-bellied frumps and the muscular women who work at the nearby hospital for the mentally retarded is a hard core of out-of-control customers who would tax the hospitality of the most venal innkeeper in the mountains of eastern Kentucky.</p>
<p>“The Rustic, in truth, is the sort of place where people grab you by the arm and say alarming things. The kind of drinking that goes on here would not be out of place in a Bolivian Mining camp, 15,000 feet up in the Andes, where the Indian miners have a life expectancy of twenty-nine years. It would not be out-of-place in Butte, Montana, either, or in most of the bars in east Los Angeles — but none of these places are rustic enough to attract the tourist trade.</p>
<p>“The same sort of brawl that would draw a dozen club-swinging cops to a bar in San Francisco’s Mission District is dismissed with a friendly chuckle in Jack London’s favorite saloon.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t sell the article until three years later, when it was published in the August 1967 issue of Cavalier, a men’s magazine, under the shortened title “Nights at the Rustic.” The owner of the roadhouse, Chester Womack, promptly sued Thompson and Cavalier for $5.5 million. “Never trust a bartender,” Thompson snapped.</p>
<div id="attachment_2372" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Hunter-guns.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2372" alt="Thompson was an ardent gun devotee.

<p>In late summer 1964, Thompson invited Bob Geiger, a local orthopedic surgeon and friend, up to the house. A few hours before dawn, the two started shooting gophers on the front lawn. The landlord, who lived next door, was furious and told the Thompsons they had to go.</p>
<p>They moved south to Sonoma to live with Geiger in a small condo he rented, but it was only temporary. By September, Thompson had had his fill of Sonoma County. He wanted to be closer to the action and grabbed a long, narrow apartment on Parnassus Street in San Francisco, near the Haight neighborhood. It was there Thompson wrote “Hell’s Angels,” the book about the infamous California motorcycle gang that launched his career and changed his life. Five years later, he authored his landmark novel, “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.”</p>
<p>But all that was ahead of him. Shortly before he moved to San Francisco for good, Thompson returned to Sonoma to pack up his remaining gear, loading it into a trailer with the help of Geiger. As the two drove away, the mattress caught the wind and flew out of the trailer, landing in the road. Hunter S. Thompson’s time in Sonoma was over, but his life as a literary icon had just begun.</p>
<p><strong>Authors Note:</strong> Hunter S. Thompson himself was a very helpful assistant in this story on the writer’s short residency in Sonoma County. He was a relentless correspondent and, beginning in his teens, made carbon copies of every letter he wrote — to his mother, his Army buddies, his girlfriends, his various agents and editors. The earliest series of those letters are collected in The Proud Highway: Saga of A Desperate Southern Gentleman, 1955-1967. The book includes dozens of pages of his correspondence during his time in Glen Ellen, from February to September 1964.&nbsp; The quotes in this story are chiefly draw from that book as well as Gonzo: The Life of Hunter S. Thompson by Jann S. Wenner and Corey Seymour, which is filled with first-person accounts of those who knew Thompson best. Thompson’s memoir Kingdom of Fear: Loathsome Secrets of a Star-Cross Child in the Final Days of the American Century was also helpful in adding perspective to his Sonoma days. In addition, critical context and backdrop was provided by a number of books, including Outlaw Journalist: The Life and Times of Hunter S. Thompson by William McKeen; Fear and Loathing: The Strange and Terrible Saga of Hunter S. Thompson by Paul Perry; When The Going Gets Weird: The Twisted Life and Times of Hunter S. Thompson by Peter O. Whitmer; and Hunter: The Strange and Savage Life of Hunter S. Thompson by E. Jean Carroll.</p>

			<div class="smallside"><em>“Once you have a second home at The Sea Ranch, there are two kinds of days in your life. ... The ordinary days you spend in the workaday world and the days you spend on this lovely stretch of seacoast — the days you wish would never end.”</em> ~ From a 1960s ad for The Sea Ranch</div>
		<div itemprop="articleBody">

		<p>Al and Diana Edgerton were tooling north to Mendocino for a July 4 getaway in 1964 when they were beckoned off Highway 1 by a “lots for sale” sign bearing a bold ram’s-horn logo.</p>
<p>The sales office had opened just that weekend for an intriguing new development dubbed “The Sea Ranch.” The deals were as seductive as the setting — thick hillside forests of redwood, fir and fern overlooking a tableland of meadows that meet the sea along a shore notched with nubbly cliffs and coves. Lots could be locked up for as little as $4,500 in the forest east of Highway 1, $8,500 in a meadow with at least a peek of the ocean.</p>
<p>“We stopped out of curiosity. We had never heard of The Sea Ranch,” Edgerton, a retired oral surgeon, remembered. “But we cut short our vacation in Elk and put a down payment on a lot.”</p>

<p>It was a radical move for a young couple with one baby and another on the way, who had yet to buy their first home. But that impulsive purchase made them pioneers in a groundbreaking experiment in land development and design that continues to resonate 50 years later.</p>
<p>The Sea Ranch was conceived amid the infant “ecology” movement sparked by Rachel Carson’s 1962 anti-pesticide exposé, “Silent Spring.” Its guiding ethos of “living lightly on the land” was defined by Sea Ranch’s celebrated designer, landscape architect Lawrence Halprin. He would inspire a revolutionary new approach to environmentally sensitive land-use planning and architecture that a half-century later is still studied and admired around the world.</p>
<p>At the same time, pitched battles over public access to The Sea Ranch’s 10 miles of ragged bluffs and beaches made for a tumultuous early history and would have a seismic impact on the future of the entire California coast. Local activists led by Petaluman Bill Kortum, later a county supervisor, spearheaded a fight for public trails into the private enclave. While their efforts failed locally, they took it to statewide voters, culminating in a 1972 ballot initiative creating the powerful California Coastal Commission and in 1976, the state Coastal Act to protect the shoreline and ensure the public can share in its beauty.</p>
<p>The clashes led to hard-won compromises. There are now six public access points to Sea Ranch beaches and a public trail at Black Point. Original plans were slashed from 5,200 to 2,429 lots, of which 1,850 are built. While there are no definitive numbers, Sea Ranch officials figure roughly one-third of the homes are occupied full time, one-third are weekenders and the remainder vacation and long-term rentals.</p>
<p>Without Sea Ranch as a catalyst for California coastal protection, mused former Sonoma County Supervisor Ernie Carpenter, “it would be gruesome out there.”</p>
<div id="attachment_2340" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEARANCH409_700238.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2340" alt="Sea Ranch Lodge." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEARANCH409_700238-300x202.jpg" width="300" height="202"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sea Ranch Lodge.</p></div>
<p>“We would be fighting access to the tidelands,” he said. “You’d have development along the North Coast in ways that would probably be more like Southern California and you would not have public ownership of the land.”</p>
<p>Eric Koenigshofer, the Sonoma County supervisor representing the coast during some of the angriest debates about a private development that would deny the public access to the coast, makes the same north-south comparison in assessing the lasting effects of Sea Ranch.</p>
<p>“When you think of Orange County and its beach communities, the Sonoma Coast could have developed like that,” he said. “No engineering problem would have prevented something like the Newport Freeway running from Santa Rosa to Bodega Bay.”</p>
<p>Still, Sea Ranch remains the largest development on an otherwise sparsely developed coast, with homes fronting 10 of the 60 miles of Sonoma County coastline. Those coveted 10 miles were part of Rancho Del Mar, a 5,200-acre sheep ranch bought from the Ohlson family for an estimated $2.7 million in 1963.</p>
<div id="attachment_2341" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEARANCH370_700213.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2341" alt="Start of pathway at Sea Ranch lodge. " src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEARANCH370_700213-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Start of pathway at Sea Ranch lodge.</p></div>
<p>During the tumultuous years of the debate that followed in the 1970s, disagreements with the new coastal regulators over Sea Ranch’s size and the public’s right to freely access the coast led to legal battles. A virtual moratorium on building sparked what amounted to a Civil War among residents in what was supposed to be a quiet refuge.</p>
<p>And there were casualties. People who had saved and purchased lots on this breathtaking stretch intended to retire there. But they were stalled as the larger political drama played out across the state. While Sea Ranch began a movement that protected the coast for all Californians, sometimes there was individual cost.</p>
<p>“There were a lot of people … in the middle of a public policy dispute,” Koenigshofer said. “They were very likeable people in the late part of their lives who had put everything they had into what they thought was going to be their dream retirement and for many it wasn’t realized.”</p>
<p>To many Sea Ranchers, those times seem lost in the fog. A generation has passed and the community has mellowed into maturity. Disagreements are more “on the squabbling level,” over abalone divers who book vacation rentals and party late, and dust-ups over vegetation — to cut or not to cut, said Jackie Gardner, who heads the elected, seven-member Sea Ranch Association Board of Directors that serves as an unofficial town council.</p>
<p>Even the early schism between The Sea Ranch and working-class Gualala residents, who regarded the newcomers as elitist SOBs (South of the Bridgers, meaning the Gualala Bridge) seems to have largely receded like the tide.</p>
<div id="attachment_2342" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEARANCH083-2_700239.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2342" alt="Field and fence near the Sea Ranch Lodge.

<p>“One of the things about The Sea Ranch is that although you have retired CEOs and very intelligent people who come up here, if they bring an attitude, they don’t make it,” Walt Jorgenson said. The burly real estate agent lived many years in Sea Ranch and boasts that his daughter is a true native, born on a dark and stormy night in his mother-in-law’s Sea Ranch home. Now he lives in Gualala, but after 30 years selling and renting homes in Sea Ranch, Jorgenson is intimate with its ways.</p>
<p>Joel Crockett, who owns Four-Eyed Frog Books in Gualala and has lived in both communities, said Gualala, where Sea Ranchers go for all their services, probably “wouldn’t exist in the form it exists if The Sea Ranch didn’t exist.”</p>
<p>Fifty years after purchasing one of the first Sea Ranch lots, the Edgertons still make the stomach-turning 2 1/2-hour drive from the East Bay to their seaside refuge. Theirs is one of the quintessential early Sea Ranch homes, a so-called “Binker Barn,” designed by William Turnbull, one of the first architects of the development. “We never envisioned ourselves staying there that long,“ Al Edgerton said. “I envisioned it getting too crowded and we’d move on somewhere else. But we haven’t.”</p>
<div id="attachment_2346" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEARANCH117_700245.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2346" alt="The living room of Donlyn Lydon's house." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEARANCH117_700245-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The living room of Donlyn Lydon’s house.</p></div>
<p>That loyalty is testament to the ideals of The Sea Ranch founders and architects, such as Donlyn Lyndon and Dick Whitaker, who still maintain weekend homes there, as well as other watchdogs inside and outside the community. With some exceptions, such as the occasional too-big home, their combined efforts have largely ensured that it would not be overbuilt or visually upstage the hillside forests to the east, open meadows teeming with wildlife and the moody surf beyond.</p>
<p>Not every early observer embraced the simple, unpainted and unadorned wood dwellings that from a distance might have appeared undistinctive. But that radical-for-the-time simplicity was deliberate.</p>
<p>“We didn’t set out to be master architects, but to be thinking in ways that had to do with the whole,” said Lyndon, who was a 27-year-old instructor at UC Berkeley when his design firm MLTW (Moore Lyndon Turnbull Whitaker) was tapped to draw up plans for the first condominium complex at Sea Ranch in 1963. Inspired by the weathered barns still dotting the land, the timber-framed “Condominium One” is now regarded as one of the most notable examples of 1960s architecture and is on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>“We expected it would be a community, not in the sense of streets with porches, but a community within a natural setting which was dominant,” Lyndon explained, while seated on a deck overlooking a large boulder set in the meadow. He said the rock is what sold him and his artist wife, Alice Wingwall, on this lot over all others — far more than the sea in the distance. “And it would be a community of people who cared about that, who wanted to bike and be near the ocean and wanted to experience the birds and the wildlife. That would be what bonded them together.”</p>
<div id="attachment_2344" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEARANCH096_700247.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2344" alt="The back side of Donlyn Lydon's house." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEARANCH096_700247-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The back side of Donlyn Lydon’s house.</p></div>
<p>The Sea Ranch is in the midst of a yearlong celebration of its first 50 years, marked by months of special events, talks and forums. It culminates May 23-24, 2015, with the premiere of an original musical piece inspired by The Sea Ranch and performed by the Kronos Quartet in the old “white barn.”</p>
<p>Over time, the community has seasoned from an early population of artsy bohemians and intellectuals into a graying community of educated, accomplished and affluent people, both retirees and weekenders (the median age is nearly 64) who traded urban excitement for quiet isolation and a lifestyle based on the outdoors and volunteerism. Residents have ranged from the late Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman to renowned psychologist and writer Philip Zimbardo, to CBS News correspondent Barry Petersen.</p>
<p>It is a tightly controlled isolation governed by rigid guidelines aimed at protecting the integrity of the community. It’s not for a rugged individualist. Every detail is managed, from the shade of the stain on your wood siding to the plants you can put in your personal landscape, all of which must be native not just to California, but to your zone on the ranch. Rules are so well-enforced by the powerful Design Committee, the elected Sea Ranch Association Board, the ranch’s security patrol and fellow residents, that decades later The Sea Ranch still evokes its farming roots. The original white Knipp-Stengel barn was restored into a meeting place and sheep trim the meadows crossed by 100-year-old cypress hedgerows running to the sea.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEARANCH064_700235.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2343" alt="" src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEARANCH064_700235-200x300.jpg" width="200" height="300"></a>“People who choose to live there are true believers,” said George Homsey, 89, who worked with the late Joe Esherick to design the first “Hedgerow Houses” at Black Point, with their sloping roofs of various pitches for wind protection. They set the standard for the Sea Ranch look.</p>
<p>Andrea Lunsford looks out her broad picture window toward the churning waves. In the foreground, hikers amble the same public trail that brought her to this exact spot from nearby Gualala Point Regional Park. She didn’t even know she’d entered a place called Sea Ranch then, but she saw a “for sale” sign and made a down payment that very day.</p>
<p>An elegant woman of 71, she welcomes people to share the views from land she is only “shepherding for a while.” When Lunsford first built her house, the Stanford emeritus professor and nationally recognized scholar on writing and rhetoric conceded she felt “constrained by the rules.” The pink plastic flamingos her friends put in front of her house in welcome led to a quick rebuke.</p>
<p>But she said she’s come to embrace Sea Ranch’s utopian ideal of putting the common good ahead of self-interest.</p>
<p>“To me, this place is about peace and calm and connection to the natural world,” said Lunsford, who still travels frequently but comes to Sea Ranch as much as possible to unwind and write from a loft with ocean views that gives her the feeling of being aboard a ship. “When I’m driving up and get to Bodega Bay and see what I think of as my ocean opening out, it’s like a physical difference comes over me. Everything lowers to a calm resting place and by the time I get here I feel so happy.”</p>
<p>To outsiders who need more action, life at Sea Ranch might appear lonely, even dull. There are no streetlights to wash out the starry skies and the chill coastal winds are fierce, so roads empty at dusk. Residents say it belies a vibrant social life both outdoors in the daytime and at night indoors, where it’s all about sharing convivial meals with friends who all seem to have an interesting story.</p>
<p>“Food seems very much a part of being here and we plan our days around it — and beautiful walks on the bluff,” said Gabriel Ramirez, a radiologist who splits his time between Los Angeles and a home office in a dramatic house of concrete and weathered Corten steel that represents a new wave of Sea Ranch design.</p>
<p>The clustered housing, designed to protect open areas shared by all and inspired by Halprin, leads to some disagreements over vegetation blocking views. But it also fosters neighborliness.</p>
<div id="attachment_2347" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/sea-ranch-coastal-legacy/searanch538-jpg/" rel="attachment wp-att-2347"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2347" alt="Courtyard of Condominium One.

<p>There are weekly summer potlucks at “The Hot Spot,” a warm pocket by the Gualala River; an annual pancake breakfast; a 110-member communal garden dubbed the Posh Squash run with corporate efficiency; an active trails committee; and a docent program to monitor seals during the pupping season.</p>
<p>“We have an active trails committee and nature walks almost every Saturday. We have the California Coastal National Monument that monitors seabirds and endangered grasses. There’s an extraordinary amount of things to do,” said Jackie Gardner, who lives in a modest house in the hillside forest with views that would cost so much more in Carmel.</p>
<p>By its very design and remote location, Sea Ranch remains a self-selected community of people who consciously choose the lifestyle. There’s no easy way to get there. Internet and cell service remain sketchy, although some residents think a new fiber optic network in the works might inspire an infusion of younger telecommuters. With only one medical clinic in Gualala, most residents subscribe to two emergency helicopter services.</p>
<p>Carolyn André, an advertising and marketing consultant for international companies, said her husband, Barry Richman, suffered an aneurysm, was airlifted to Santa Rosa and survived.</p>
<div id="attachment_2348" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/sea-ranch-coastal-legacy/searanch335-jpg/" rel="attachment wp-att-2348"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2348" alt="Carolyn Andre's house at night.

<p>The couple lived for years in Berkeley, where they had season tickets to the ballet and opera. Now they get their cultural infusion at the Gualala Arts Center. They catch recorded Metropolitan Opera performances and British plays at the old Arena Theater, a half-hour drive north.</p>
<p>“It may not be in the flesh, but they are spectacular events,” André said with a laugh. “And you get to go in your blue jeans with your brown-bag lunch.”</p>
<p>Add the cliff-hugging 30-mile trip north from Jenner, and you weed out anyone who is isn’t comfortable blending inconspicuously into the landscape in the same way as the architecture.</p>
<p>“This whole area is quite an egalitarian place,” said Mary Alinder, a longtime Sea Ranch resident and Gualala gallery owner who was an executive assistant to the renowned photographer Ansel Adams and co-authored his autobiography. “It’s not a place for flashy clothes or high heels or jewelry. If you’re into shopping, this is not the place. If you like nightlife, this is not the place. I truly believe if you start talking to any individual here you will find someone who has contributed to this Earth in some wonderful way. People who choose to live here have a lot in common and often they like being removed from the urban areas.”</p>
<p>Sea Ranchers don’t pretend they live in a utopia.</p>
<div id="attachment_2349" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEARANCH324_700237.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2349" alt="Deer in a meadow near Sea Ranch Lodge." src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SEARANCH324_700237-300x179.jpg" width="300" height="179"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Deer in a meadow near Sea Ranch Lodge.</p></div>
<p>Lisa Dundee, an architect who heads up the all-powerful committee that controls every detail of Sea Ranch design, laments the increase in property values pushed, in part, by an influx of people in the 1990s who didn’t understand the rules were a common sacrifice for a different kind of reward. Recent listings for lots at The Sea Ranch ranged from $25,000 for the forest up to $795,000 for an ocean view. House prices range from $299,000 for a 40-year-old, 567-square-foot forest cabin to $3.8 million for a luxury estate on 4 oceanfront acres.</p>
<p>“After you’ve lived up here awhile you recognize the greater good and find a way to accommodate to it rather than expect your environment to accommodate to you.”</p>
<p>Residents speak of the peace they find at The Sea Ranch and the thrill of watching nature at play, a legacy of the original vision that remains, having withstood the battering of economic, political and environmental forces over more than half a century.</p>
<p>In the end, André said, the magic of the place comes back to the one natural wonder that can never be replicated and that all of California feared losing when the development was begun so long ago: “I do think it’s the ocean — the smell, the sound, the movement, even the colors, the light glinting off it.”</p>

<p><strong>1846:</strong> Ernest Rufus receives 17,580-acre Mexican land grant from Gualala River to Ocean Cove and sends Frederick Hugal to make improvements to what becomes “Rancho de Hermann.”</p>
<p><strong>1860:</strong> After changing hands several times, the land is turned over to Chris Stengel and Adam Knipp, who raise cattle and log timber, shipping from what they call Walhhala Ranch, or Gualala.</p>
<p><strong>1904:</strong> William and George Bender buy the 5,200-acre Knipp Stengel Ranch and create the Rancho del Mar settlement that would eventually become The Sea Ranch.</p>
<p><strong>1910:</strong> Their Del Mar Mill burns, residents disperse, and the land is eventually purchased by Walter P. Frick. He raises sheep and plants cypress hedgerows.</p>
<p><strong>1941:</strong> The Ohlson family of Annapolis buys Del Mar Ranch at auction after Frick dies and the land is seized for back taxes.</p>
<p><strong>1963:</strong> Oceanic Properties, a subsidiary of Hawaiian developers Castle &amp; Cooke, pays an estimated $2.7 million for the Ohlson ranch with plans to develop a “high quality second home colony.” Landscape architect Lawrence Halprin is hired to design a plan that would minimally disrupt the natural landscape.</p>
<p><strong>1964:</strong> Sonoma County OKs plans for the southern edge of Sea Ranch. Ground is broken on three demonstration projects designed by a team of young Bay Area architects.</p>
<p><strong>1965:</strong> The guiding principles of The Sea Ranch, contained in 111 pages of rules, are filed May 10, considered by many the official “birthday” of the development.</p>
<p><strong>1966:</strong> The design world begins to recognize Sea Ranch with the first of many awards, including The Governor’s Design Award for planned communities. Controversy stirs over public access to Sea Ranch beaches.</p>
<p><strong>1968:</strong> Petaluma veterinarian Bill Kortum leads citizens’ fight for public access to Sea Ranch. Measure B, which would have required new coastal development in Sonoma County to provide public-access corridors, is defeated.</p>
<p><strong>1972:</strong> Coast Alliance takes the case to statewide voters who approve Proposition 20, setting up the California Coastal Commission to oversee coastal development and ensure public access.</p>
<p><strong>1973:</strong> The Coastal Commission, concerned about population projections of 15,000 people at buildout in The Sea Ranch and access issues, begins denying permits, leading to a virtual building moratorium. A protracted legal fight begins between the state and regional commissions and The Sea Ranch Association. Many lot owners are in limbo and the community divides deeply.</p>
<p><strong>1980s:</strong> The Bane Bill is approved by the Legislature, settling the fight. Coastal authorities win on most points, including requiring five public-access trails from the highway to the beach, but relinquish permitting powers over The Sea Ranch. A financially battered Oceanic focuses on premium lots and development of the north end in a way many felt was less in the spirit of Halprin’s original design.</p>
<p><strong>2014:</strong> Plans are announced for a yearlong 50th birthday celebration of The Sea Ranch.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.sonomamag.com/sea-ranch-coastal-legacy/lawrence-halprin/" rel="attachment wp-att-2351"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2351" alt="Lawrence Halprin" src="http://www.sonomamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Lawrence-Halprin.jpg" width="330" height="440"></a>Lawrence Halprin: A Man With Vision</strong></p>
<p>Lawrence Halprin, designer of The Sea Ranch, envisioned a community of rustic homes, set in the land in a way that would protect the views and clustered around open meadows where the natural flora is scrupulously preserved.</p>
<p>He camped at Sea Ranch while working on his plans for 10 miles of coastal meadows and forests, observing wind and weather patterns, soil and vegetation, and the contours of the land. He noted shadows, tidal changes, cormorant nests, kelp beds and seal colonies, all to incorporate development rather than carve it out of the landscape.</p>
<p>Halprin characterized The Sea Ranch challenge as “a wonderful experiment in ecological planning … a place where nature and human habitation could intersect in the kind of intense symbiosis that would allow people to become part of the ecosystem.”</p>
<p>His unconventional plans, illustrated with freehand drawings, included condominiums — a new housing concept that raised eyebrows at the time. His intent was to leave as small a footprint as possible, protect open spaces for walking and recreation, and to not wall off “the constant presence of the Pacific views.” Roads had no curbs or sidewalks. He planted more than 100,000 trees.</p>
<p>Halprin, whose other design triumphs include Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco, Sproul Plaza in Berkeley, the pedestrian approach to Yosemite Falls and the Franklin Roosevelt Memorial in Washington, D.C., left The Sea Ranch project in the late 1960s yet maintained a home there, returning often before his death in 2009.</p>
