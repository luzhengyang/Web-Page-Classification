They are reporting me 90 days late in months I didn't even owe them a payment. The detailed payment history Wells Fargo mailed me says on Oct 17 direct payoff 287.24 while my back account shows that payment was 365.79. </p><p>I purchased car on 6-23-07 but my statements from Wachovia came with a due date that did not match my contract so they called me after taking payments from me and said they had to change my due date to August 22 instead of the 1st making me pay 2 weeks earlier. Which resulted in poor accounting from Wells Fargo resulting in unfair late fees &amp; compound interest, unfair credit reporting and asking/accepting more money than actually owed upon their phone call to collect the last payment paid that shouldn't have even been owed and even overcharged on what the amount actually said according to their detailed payment history. </p><p>After many disputes Wells Fargo president's office has verified inaccurate credit reporting data and denies ever changing my due date however Equifax reports my loan opened on 7-1-07. How could I have opened a loan before I even bought the car proves Wells Fargo changed my due date especially when they change dates around resulting in NO grace period at least 4 times resulting in unfair credit reporting and overcharged late fees &amp; compound interest..</p><div class="adUnit"><script type="text/javascript">

And I also paid five hundred some dollars to cover the difference. And all I want was to find out my biweekly authorization is valid. But thru automated I am finding out that I am late for two payments. I took a day off to clear this problem. Today I been calling since 12. Either line get disconnected after 15 or 20 minutes or it says 'we are currently unavailable.' Sent e-mails and the email respond as system unavailable.

I have banked exclusively with Wells Fargo for over 11 years and have overlooked too many issues. This is the final straw! I should have listened to my bookkeeper last year and ditched this abhorrent financial institution. WF has in the 6 figures of my cash at all times. They have the audacity to be this greedy? I wish I had listened and seen the terrible ratings of this bank. Sadly, I have always said good things about WF amid banker errors multiple times. It's only $100, but it's the principle. Credit Union here I come. Thanks WF for giving me this final push!!! I'll see you one last time to get bank checks closing both my personal and business accounts. I am so glad I didn't start a health savings account for my employees with WF. I'm sure there is some fine print somewhere detailing this would happen, so I will take the blame and then my business elsewhere.</p></div><ul class="review-actions"><li class="add-company-response"><a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/brands/?claim_campaign_id=1410" class="hidden-phone">add your response</a></li></ul><span class="review-meta"><span class="feedback"><span class="text">Helpful?</span><a href="#" class="yes">Yes</a><a href="#" class="no">No</a></span></span></div></div></div><div class="review" id="review-853274" itemprop="review" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Review"><div class="review-post user-post complaint"><div class="post-info clearfix"><img src="https://consumeraffairs.global.ssl.fastly.net/static/img/common/user-pic-micro.b5dd38afb1c4.png" class="author-pic" width="50" height="50"><div class="post-author"><span class="author-name" itemprop="author">angela of Keene, NH</span> on <span class="post-date" content="2014-10-14 23:13:06+00:00" itemprop="datePublished">Oct. 14, 2014</span></div><div class="review-rating updated-rating" itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" itemscope="" itemprop="reviewRating"><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="1"><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="5"><span class="label">Satisfaction Rating</span><span class="star-container color-rating"><span class="stars rate-1"><span itemprop="ratingValue">1</span>/5

Plus for a year they were charging me for insurance saying I didn't have it but the car dealer faxed it before they'd let me drive away with it. Then my insurance company faxed it 4 times. So then I was in the hole with them for a year, so they make a whole lot of money on me... </p><p>I lost my job so I make agreement for them to take 2 payments with a fee because it was on the phone. When they took the second one, they took it two days earlier than we agreed, bounce three things in my checking account. I get paid once a week so I know what I agreed to. So now they're calling me saying that the payments that They TOOK they haven't gotten. He kept talking over me, arguing when I said I have the bank statement saying otherwise and the bank is mailing a copy on just the payments they took. I'm sick of being harassed, scammed.

I told the rep that I was told that it is auto payment, but it was not. So made two months payments. Next month I saw that Wells Fargo reported to two credit bureaus for the late payments. I called the Wells Fargo customer service, and explained to them the situation. The lady Julia blatantly told me that we will not remove it as courtesy. I was really mad, that I have never been late and one time I was late and even they know that it was my bank's system error, they still reported to credit bureau.

Also, I took the letter from my Mom's neurologist, stating she needed to appoint a POA due to having the beginning stages of Alzheimer's Disease. But at that date she was suffering from mild cognitive impairment but was competent to appoint a POA. I'll give you a short version of a very intense deep financial matter that is declining rapidly due to Wells Fargo not recognizing both types of Durable POAs I have in regards to my mother's finances. I am the eldest daughter and I have co-owned a checking acct at WF with my mom for the past ten years. </p><p>Mom and her only sister have not had much to do with each other over the past ten years. Mom has lived with me and my family (on and off) for the past two years. Mom could not stand to be around her sister nor could she stand to go visit her sister because her sister's house is in very poor condition. She's a hoarder. She abuses street and prescription drugs. She has never held a full time job (but has two Master's Degrees from an influential college). She is a great manipulator. She lied about her marital status to a roommate she had, and is currently living off of his social security benefits (this roommate passed away ten years ago).</p><p>Me and my family went on vacation the last two weeks in July and mom's sister, Julie, moved in on mom and was buying her Vodka and has been keeping mom drunk. Julie has not taken mom to any of her doctor's appointments, has not had Mom's prescriptions filled, and took mom to WF to finance a car. WF was well aware of Mom's illness and her incompetence, but allowed mom to finance $14,000.00, allowed mom to make cash withdrawals from our joint checking account (mom made these w/d's from the teller's window with only her driver's license for identification), when the account was supposedly flagged. </p><p>The cash withdrawals over a ten day span added up to about $4,000.00. Mom has no bills that she needed to pay because I've written out her bills for her for about three years now. When charges started appearing on a WF CREDIT CARD that was in Mom's name I started disputing all of these transactions because I knew mom was not charging anything to a credit card. There were also many withdrawals made from mom's equity credit line, withdrawals from her WF PERSONAL LINE OF CREDIT, checks written that did not pertain to me or to my mom, and it goes on and on. Julie is robbing and stealing all of mom's money and I have contacted everyone at WF that I figured could help put an end to this. So far, NO HELP! </p><p>Julie is now accusing me of stealing my mom's money, writing checks to myself for cash, using mom's debit card for all purchases made from the debit card, and the Spanish Fort WF Branch Manager, Allison, is allowing Julie to have access to all of mom's financial records, allowing Julie to close out the account that I co-owned with mom and that is the same account that I utilized to pay mom's bills from. I no longer have access to any of my mom's financial records at WF and Julie is continuing to lie on me and accusing me of stealing money from my mom as well as accusing me of fraudulent activities. The two different types of Durable POA's that I have over mom and her finances gives me and only me access to do as I need to do in the best interest of my mom. </p><p>She even stated in one of the DPOA documents that she gave me permission to sign her name to checks and permission to do whatever I deemed necessary for the best financial activities that were of mom's best interest. Well, DHR Elder Care representative came out to my house to interview me after I had put in a call to file an ELDER ABUSE CLAIM against Julie for robbing mom, stealing over $10,000.00 (ASIC this date) from mom's numerous WF accounts, not properly caring for mom, not taking mom to any of her doctor appts, which includes her oncologist, not giving mom her prescribed medication because she's out of medicine and Julie has yet to purchase refills. She is supplying mom with Vodka and is keeping mom drunk. </p><p>Julie will not allow anyone to visit mom. Julie keeps mom's cell phone and screens all of mom's incoming phone calls, and will not allow mom to make any phone call without talking in Julie's presence. Mom needs help!!! I cannot find the right person that will help me get my mom back!!! I need to sell her house, sell her waterfront property, put her in an assisted living facility where she would be properly cared for, and then file charges against Wells Fargo for all the wrong they allowed an unauthorized person to do to mom's financial records. </p><p>I am filing another suit against WF to recover all the monies that they allowed Julie to steal from Mom's personal checking and credit accounts, and monies spent to purchase a car that mom can no longer utilize nor was she capable of driving at the time when WF financed the money to purchase the car, and all local WF branch managers were well aware of Mom's diagnosis, her mental status, and the status of her sister....knowing Julie dId not have POA nor any other documents that put Julie over any of Mom's belongings, finances, medical records, nothing. I need to know what to do about this and how to get mom placed in an assisted living facility.</p></div><ul class="review-actions"><li class="add-company-response"><a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/brands/?claim_campaign_id=1410" class="hidden-phone">add your response</a></li></ul><span class="review-meta"><span class="feedback"><span class="text">Helpful?</span><a href="#" class="yes">Yes</a><a href="#" class="no">No</a></span></span></div></div></div><div class="review" id="review-851277" itemprop="review" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Review"><div class="review-post user-post complaint"><div class="post-info clearfix"><img src="https://consumeraffairs.global.ssl.fastly.net/static/img/common/user-pic-micro.b5dd38afb1c4.png" class="author-pic" width="50" height="50"><div class="post-author"><span class="author-name" itemprop="author">Dana of Hobson, TX</span> on <span class="post-date" content="2014-10-10 16:22:18+00:00" itemprop="datePublished">Oct. 10, 2014</span></div><div class="review-rating updated-rating" itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" itemscope="" itemprop="reviewRating"><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="1"><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="5"><span class="label">Satisfaction Rating</span><span class="star-container color-rating"><span class="stars rate-1"><span itemprop="ratingValue">1</span>/5

They went with Wells Fargo because that is who their current mortgage is with. They owe approx. $90,000 and asked to refinance for $130,000 and they were offered a lower interest rate if choosing to refinance with Wells Fargo. Their credit is excellent and the house appraised for $265,000 as is, through a company Wells Fargo hired. Wells Fargo had them write a check and said it was for the refinance fees and appraisal. Just before closing she received a call telling her they needed her to fix her deck before they gave her the money... She told them she couldn't until she received the money and that was the end of all correspondence from Wells Fargo. </p><p>She has now waited 3 days to hear from them even after emailing them wanting to know what was happening. She finally got a call from a lady in the office today who let her know they decided not to give her the loan. Then they cashed her check which clearly says in the memo it was for closing cost and appraisal. I talked to an attorney who said it sounds like discrimination... I am picking up the paperwork tomorrow and will get to the bottom of what is going on. Feels like a scam to me... No wonder Wells Fargo has more than 900 complaints.

Recently I noticed that my credit card had expired and I had not received a new one. If you work someplace that does not allow you to make personal calls during those hours, you are stuck. Because I work during that incredibly narrow customer service window, and am not allowed to make personal calls, I sent an email via their secured messaging center, telling them that I had not received a new card and I was concerned that it could end up in the wrong hands and leave me a victim of identity theft. Their customer service department refuses to cancel that card without speaking to me on the phone. They also refuse to issue me a new card without speaking to me on the phone. </p><p>This seems ridiculous to me - the company will bear the loss of any amount of money that might result from fraudulent charges. Speaking to me over the phone is absolutely no guarantee that they are getting the real person and not a thief. Additionally, why can't they simply send a new card to the address of record? I have been paying the bill every month from my current address that is on file with my credit card account. </p><p>So because their customer service department insists that they speak to some random person over the phone before they either cancel one card or issue a new one, and I am never able to make a call during their hours, I have no alternatives left except to close the account. Seems drastic, don't you think? And not a very smart business plan. Just thought someone should know, as I am willing to bet I'm not the only customer with this problem.</p></div><ul class="review-actions"><li class="add-company-response"><a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/brands/?claim_campaign_id=1410" class="hidden-phone">add your response</a></li></ul><span class="review-meta"><span class="feedback"><span class="text">Helpful?</span><a href="#" class="yes">Yes</a><a href="#" class="no">No</a></span></span></div></div></div><div class="review" id="review-850655" itemprop="review" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Review"><div class="review-post user-post complaint"><div class="post-info clearfix"><img src="https://consumeraffairs.global.ssl.fastly.net/static/img/common/user-pic-micro.b5dd38afb1c4.png" class="author-pic" width="50" height="50"><div class="post-author"><span class="author-name" itemprop="author">Lynne of Aurora, CO</span> on <span class="post-date" content="2014-10-09 02:26:13+00:00" itemprop="datePublished">Oct. 9, 2014</span></div><div class="review-rating updated-rating" itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" itemscope="" itemprop="reviewRating"><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="1"><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="5"><span class="label">Satisfaction Rating</span><span class="star-container color-rating"><span class="stars rate-1"><span itemprop="ratingValue">1</span>/5

We have excellent credit and already had our primary mortgage with them, so we thought everything should go smoothly. Everything did seem to be going well, until it came down to the appraisal. They said we would need to have an appraisal done to verify we had enough equity in our home for the HELOC. A home identical to ours and in our neighborhood had just sold for $100,000 more than what we owned so we were not too concerned.</p><p>When we received the appraisal report, it came back $60,000 less than the identical house sold for a month earlier. I thought okay, maybe they did the drive by appraisal on the wrong house because this just did not make any sense. I started doing a little checking and found they used houses that were more than 10 miles from ours even through there were several recent sales in our neighborhood and the surrounding neighborhoods that could be used for comps. They also used properties that were much older and with less sq ft.</p><p>I have bought and sold several houses over the years and this has not been the norm so I tried to call the appraiser. The phone number on the appraisal report was disconnected. An internet search of the appraisal company name came back with a different number, but that number was also disconnected. This started raising red flags for me, so I checked with the state of Colorado licensing board. The company is listed as a licensed company, but not with this appraiser and the phone listed is the personal voice mail of a completely different person. </p><p>I did another license search using the appraiser name and it came back as a "mortgage loan originator" license for the same appraisal company and this license did list the original phone number from the appraisal report, but the license expired in 2010. At this point, we are not sure what is going on with Wells Fargo so we have started the process of pulling all of our accounts and cut all ties before we become a statistic.</p></div><ul class="review-actions"><li class="add-company-response"><a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/brands/?claim_campaign_id=1410" class="hidden-phone">add your response</a></li></ul><span class="review-meta"><span class="feedback"><span class="text">Helpful?</span><a href="#" class="yes">Yes</a><a href="#" class="no">No</a></span></span></div></div></div><div class="review" id="review-849448" itemprop="review" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Review"><div class="review-post user-post complaint"><div class="post-info clearfix"><img src="https://consumeraffairs.global.ssl.fastly.net/static/img/common/user-pic-micro.b5dd38afb1c4.png" class="author-pic" width="50" height="50"><div class="post-author"><span class="author-name" itemprop="author">rose of Fayetteville , NC</span> on <span class="post-date" content="2014-10-06 20:45:48+00:00" itemprop="datePublished">Oct. 6, 2014</span></div><div class="review-rating updated-rating" itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" itemscope="" itemprop="reviewRating"><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="1"><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="5"><span class="label">Satisfaction Rating</span><span class="star-container color-rating"><span class="stars rate-1"><span itemprop="ratingValue">1</span>/5

On Saturday, October 4, 2014, I happened to be out of town in Greenville, NC, and I went into the Wells Fargo branch located on Stantonsburg Rd. to make my deposit, because of time constraints I was not able to do so in Raleigh, that Friday. I didn't think that it would have been a problem, since it is still Wells Fargo. Boy, I was wrong. Normally when I make a deposit into this rental account, I would complete the deposit slip with my landlord's name, address and indicate that this is checking account entitled RENTAL. When I would make this transaction in Raleigh, I would have no problem at all, the tellers are more than willing to help. But in Greenville they had a nasty attitude, unprofessional, and uninformed. </p><p>When I presented my deposit slip along with the money, the teller proceeds to tell me that I could not make a deposit because I didn't have the account number. I explained to her that I just wanted to make a deposit in the account with the name and address that was indicated in the deposit slip. She said "NO, we don't look up accounts with just the address, you have to have the account number." I told her that I have made several deposit before and I have never been questioned about the account number, she said in a firm voice, "WE DON'T DO THAT HERE." She proceeded to call the so called supervisor and she repeated the same statement. I asked her when did Wells Fargo change their policy because I just perform this same transaction last month in Raleigh with no problem, and she indicated that "WE DON'T DO THAT IN GREENVILLE." I asked her when did it change, and she said several months ago, which I knew that was a lie. As I proceeded to walk out, I heard her (the supervisor) say to the teller she'll be alright. Really, is the the way Wells Fargo conduct business, you have different set of rules for different locations. You all need to get on one accord with your guidelines and procedures.</p></div><ul class="review-actions"><li class="add-company-response"><a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/brands/?claim_campaign_id=1410" class="hidden-phone">add your response</a></li></ul><span class="review-meta"><span class="feedback"><span class="text">Helpful?</span><a href="#" class="yes">Yes</a><a href="#" class="no">No</a></span></span></div></div></div><div class="review" id="review-848663" itemprop="review" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Review"><div class="review-post user-post complaint"><div class="post-info clearfix"><img src="https://consumeraffairs.global.ssl.fastly.net/static/img/common/user-pic-micro.b5dd38afb1c4.png" class="author-pic" width="50" height="50"><div class="post-author"><span class="author-name" itemprop="author">LAWRENCE of Cottageville, SC</span> on <span class="post-date" content="2014-10-04 13:04:36+00:00" itemprop="datePublished">Oct. 4, 2014</span></div><div class="review-rating updated-rating" itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" itemscope="" itemprop="reviewRating"><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="1"><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="5"><span class="label">Satisfaction Rating</span><span class="star-container color-rating"><span class="stars rate-2"><span itemprop="ratingValue">2</span>/5

My account was accessed Dec 16, 2008 by an employee in one of their branches unknown to me. So they begin withdrawing $19.90 every month. I was originally told that it was part of my car insurance (which made no sense to me). It was explain by a bank employee that sometimes the insurance is broken up into two payments. Still this made no sense, but I said "ok". </p><p>Fast forward... I decide to call my State Farm Agent and ask why they were making two separate transactions on my account. State Farm denied doing this. Nevertheless, I started calling the number that was on the online statement. First, no one ever answered the phone. That was a red flag for me. I kept calling. Well, on March 19, 2014, someone answered the phone. I asked what type of business was this. I was told that it was "AIG" insurance that was offered through the bank. </p><p>The rep for AIG ask for my information. She then proceeded to tell me that nothing matched what she had in her system. Then, I told that I have never signed up for anything at the bank. She then told me that the only way I could get it was to sign up through a banker at a branch. And because of the "Privacy Act" she could not give me anymore information (because my info did not match what she had in the system). I called AIG back. I got Jordan, a rep for AIG. He stated that the reason for not giving me any information about the withdrawals is because the person who the insurance was issued to was not me, but the money had been coming from my account.</p><p>So, I called Wells Fargo and told them that someone in their branch had "FRAUDULENTLY" accessed my account and requested that they investigate and return my $1500.00 to my account, because it was "UNAUTHORIZED". They agreed to do so. Well, today I received a letter stating that they will not return my money. I am OUTRAGED and STRESSED! They state in the letter that it was "UNAUTHORIZED" but they are not responsible for refunding my money.</p><p>I would urge anyone banking with them to "CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNTS IMMEDIATELY"! Sad, when "EMPLOYERS" UPHOLD COMPANY THEFT! I even called the executive customer service which is the office of John Stumpf, CEO of Wells Fargo. The executive customer service told me she was "sorry", but they are not refunding my money.</p></div><ul class="review-actions"><li class="add-company-response"><a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/brands/?claim_campaign_id=1410" class="hidden-phone">add your response</a></li></ul><span class="review-meta"><span class="feedback"><span class="text">Helpful?</span><a href="#" class="yes">Yes</a><a href="#" class="no">No</a></span></span></div></div></div><div class="review" id="review-846853" itemprop="review" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Review"><div class="review-post user-post complaint"><div class="post-info clearfix"><img src="https://consumeraffairs.global.ssl.fastly.net/static/img/common/user-pic-micro.b5dd38afb1c4.png" class="author-pic" width="50" height="50"><div class="post-author"><span class="author-name" itemprop="author">Scott of San Francisco, CA</span> on <span class="post-date" content="2014-09-30 03:08:47+00:00" itemprop="datePublished">Sept. 30, 2014</span></div><div class="review-rating updated-rating" itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" itemscope="" itemprop="reviewRating"><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="1"><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="5"><span class="label">Satisfaction Rating</span><span class="star-container color-rating"><span class="stars rate-1"><span itemprop="ratingValue">1</span>/5

I don't see why they can't simply decline the transactions automatically.

A Forensic Mortgage Audit proves fraud. And handwriting expert proves pasted signatures and forgery. Wells Fargo reports to credit reports a made up person created between husband and wife. I the wife am now my husband with placing his SS to my name so now I have 2 identity. NC Dept of Rev. show husband deceased related to mortgage loans 5 accts in one year. They have taken his name or identity and gave it a new identity to pass dirty money. </p><p>Upon knowing the facts still disobeys a TRO filed hours before the sale to stop it and a new court date set to show evidence for relief, tells the court the foreclosure was already done anyway and motion to dismiss should be granted. After presenting a 15,000 check that was made out by a town city council woman whom is a notary working for a lawyer filed an affidavit the loan was done in 2004 and we got proceeds from this so called loan close. In presentment to the court a counterfeit altered check that she post dates the check for 05/10/2014. Not only is it a post dated check for 2 months out but the date is a far cry from 2004. </p><p>Having the check analyzed by a former FBI agent and expert in handwriting confirms the notary made up the check and endorses the back. The judicial system has done nothing to stop them after numerous complaints and the facts in their face. We sit in our home waiting on eviction with something we did not do. Our life and hard work taken, even our identity of a married couple taken and some person or entity created to do dirty deeds. In the strangest banking I have ever seen, loans just payoff way too early we are never told and keep making payments and then to submit federal bonds, clean renewable energy bonds and Construction bonds, Midwestern tax bonds in a 1099 like they paid me money and forced to put on my taxes. </p><p>Our rights to appeal was worthless because no fraud was even mentioned. We wonder where are my rights? Consumer protection and our government seems to think this is a private matter and will not protect me from these crimes. They do nothing. Maybe it is the money behind this shady deal, 45 million to be exact - pooled thru Fannie Mae and linked to my mortgage assignment. We are still in our home. The foreclosure was several months ago and we refuse to leave. Where is justice? Wells Fargo should be shut down and forced to stop taking innocent persons' homes.</p></div><ul class="review-actions"><li class="add-company-response"><a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/brands/?claim_campaign_id=1410" class="hidden-phone">add your response</a></li></ul><span class="review-meta"><span class="feedback"><span class="text">Helpful?</span><a href="#" class="yes">Yes</a><a href="#" class="no">No</a></span></span></div></div></div><div class="review" id="review-846114" itemprop="review" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Review"><div class="review-post user-post complaint"><div class="post-info clearfix"><img src="https://consumeraffairs.global.ssl.fastly.net/static/img/common/user-pic-micro.b5dd38afb1c4.png" class="author-pic" width="50" height="50"><div class="post-author"><span class="author-name" itemprop="author">Stephanie of Lexington, KY</span> on <span class="post-date" content="2014-09-27 21:48:11+00:00" itemprop="datePublished">Sept. 27, 2014</span></div><div class="review-rating updated-rating" itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" itemscope="" itemprop="reviewRating"><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="1"><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="5"><span class="label">Satisfaction Rating</span><span class="star-container color-rating"><span class="stars rate-5"><span itemprop="ratingValue">5</span>/5

Upon logging into my account, I saw that $800 had been withdrawn, which effectively amounted to every last dime in the account. Panicked, I called Wells Fargo to file a claim. Everyone I spoke to on the phone was extremely pleasant, seemed genuinely concerned with resolving the issue, and informed me that they would investigate and the issue should be resolved within 2 days.</p><p>Still, after hanging up with the claims rep, I remained panicked. I am a 25-year-old graduate student and barely scrape by, so an $800 loss would have been devastating to me. As such, I made the mistake of reading reviews of Wells Fargo ATM/Debit Fraud situations and was inundated with horror story after horror story about Wells Fargo blaming the consumer for fraudulent ATM charges in situations where a PIN number had been used. At this point, I became convinced that I was going to be out this $800 through no fault of my own.</p><p>Less than 3 hours after initially reporting the claim, I received an e-mail informing me that the investigation had been completed and that there was indeed an error and that my account had been credited the full amount that had been fraudulently withdrawn. I cannot speak highly enough for how quickly, efficiently, and kindly Wells Fargo handled this situation and assuaged my stress. Quite frankly, I think that a lot of the negative reviews Wells Fargo has received in similar situations stem from people not reporting fraudulent activity quickly enough, people whose information has not been stolen but rather are being scammed by a family member or friend who had access to the account, or people who had been careless with their account information.</p><p>After having such a positive experience, I felt compelled to leave this positive review amidst this sea of negativity. Far too often, I think, people are only compelled to get online and write reviews when they've had a negative experience, but never document their positive experiences. This is especially true with financial institutions. Rest assured, despite reviews that indicate the contrary, if you find yourself in a similar situation as I was in, so long as you report the situation in a timely manner, Wells Fargo WILL work hard to make sure it is resolved. They did not have to go out of their way to resolve a situation that ultimately worth a relatively small sum of money so quickly, but they did. I cannot thank them enough for working hard to ensure that my account and my money is safe.</p></div><ul class="review-actions"><li class="add-company-response"><a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/brands/?claim_campaign_id=1410" class="hidden-phone">add your response</a></li></ul><span class="review-meta"><span class="feedback"><span class="text">Helpful?</span><a href="#" class="yes">Yes</a><a href="#" class="no">No</a></span></span><div id="place_after_test_div"></div></div></div></div></section><nav class="pagination"><a rel="next" class="next" href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/finance/wells_fargo.html?page=2">Next page</a></nav><div id="post-reviews"></div></div></div></div><section id="company-profile"><div id="lazyCharts" class="page-divider"><div class="header"><h2>Wells Fargo Company Profile</h2></div></div><div id="company-information" class="row" itemprop="branchOf" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Corporation"><div id="basic-information" class="span8"><h4>Basic Information</h4><dl class="dl-horizontal"><dt>Company Name:</dt><dd itemprop="name">Wells Fargo</dd><dt>Year Founded:</dt><dd itemprop="foundingDate">1852</dd><dt>Address:</dt><dd>420 Montgomery Street </dd><dt>City:</dt><dd>San Francisco</dd><dt>State/Province:</dt><dd>CA</dd><dt>Postal Code:</dt><dd>94104</dd><dt>Country:</dt><dd>United States</dd><dt>Website:</dt><dd itemprop="url">
