         <ul class="faq">
           <li><a href="#">Why should I order foreign currency before I leave?</a>
             <div>It's a good idea to have some cash on hand for immediate expenses such as a taxi ride from the airport, a meal, or for tips. You can avoid the hassle of exchanging upon arrival as some airports and train stations don't have exchange offices, or could be closed when you arrive.</div><br>
           </li>
           <li><a href="#">How can I order foreign currency (cash)?</a>
             <div>You can order:
                  <ul>
                     <li>Online. It takes just minutes to get your rate and place your order.</li>
                     <li>By phone. Please call us at 1-800-626-9430, Monday through Friday, 5 am to 6 pm, Saturday 7 am to 2 pm Pacific Time.</li>

                  </ul>
             </div><br>
           </li>
           <li><a href="#">Do Wells Fargo banking stores carry foreign currency?</a>
             <div>Yes, more than 800 Wells Fargo banking locations are designated as <a href="/FES/stores/locator.html">International Teller Site Locator</a> and have a select range of foreign currency on hand. Please contact the location in advance for specific currency availability and store hours.</div><br>
           </li>
           <li><a href="#">How much foreign currency can I order?</a>
             <div><p>For online orders, you can order a maximum of $3,000 (USD equivalent) per day. You must order at least $200(USD equivalent). If you're ordering multiple currencies, the minimum purchase amount for each currency is $25 (USD equivalent).</p>
             <p>For orders over $3,000 (equivalent), please stop by a Wells Fargo banking location that is designated as an <a href="/FES/stores/locator.html">International Teller Site</a> or call us at 1-800-626-9430 to place an order.
             </p></div>
           </li>
           <li><a href="#">How can I pay for my purchase?</a>
             <div>When placing an order online, Wells Fargo customers can pay using their Wells Fargo checking or savings account or any customer can pay with a personal Visa® or MasterCard® credit or debit card. Due to our extensive verification process, cards issued by credit unions or under a business entity may not be verifiable.</div><br>
           </li>
           <li><a href="#">Will this purchase be charged as a cash advance on my credit or debit card?</a>
             <div>Online transactions are processed by Wells Fargo as a miscellaneous purchase, and are normally posted as a purchase on your card statement. Wells Fargo does not assess a cash advance or other transaction fee related to a credit or debit card transaction. However, your card issuer may independently assess a cash advance or other transaction fee which could be included on your card statement. Please check with your card issuer regarding any fees.</div><br>
           </li>
		   <li><a href="#">How will this purchase affect the available credit on my debit or credit card account?</a>
				<div><p>Generally, when you select the "place order" button for your purchase and the order is confirmed, your available credit will be reduced by the pre-authorized amount of your order.</p>
				<p><strong>Successful Orders</strong><br>You will know your order has been successfully processed when you receive an email confirmation with a package tracking number. Upon successful order processing and shipment, your debit or credit account will be charged for the amount of your order.</p>
				<p><strong>Non-successful Orders</strong><br>Even if your order is successfully submitted and you receive an order confirmation number online, additional verifications are performed for your security. In some instances, Wells Fargo may need to later cancel or reject the order you've placed. If this occurs, we will contact you immediately.</p>
				<div>If your order is not successfully processed, your available credit may still be reduced by the pre-authorized amount of your order.
				<ul>
				<li>Please note that the release of these pre-authorized funds is determined by your debit or credit card issuer.</li>
				<li>In general, the card issuer may hold the pre-authorized funds for 3 to10 working days until the pre-authorization expires.</li>
				<li>Please contact your card issuer if you have questions about pre-authorized funds.</li>
				<li>If you used a Wells Fargo debit or credit card and you have questions about pre-authorized funds, please contact us at the number on the back of your card.</li>
				</ul>
				</div>
				</div>
			</li>
           <li><a href="#">What does "Availability" mean?</a>
             <div>Availability refers to the number of business days it will take for Wells Fargo to process your order. It may take longer to process orders with certain less popular currencies.</div><br>
           </li>
           <li><a href="#">Why is the estimated delivery date different from the "Availability"?</a>

         <h2>Rates</h2>
         <ul class="faq">
         <li><a href="#">Why are rates quoted on your site different than those I see elsewhere?</a>
             <div>Rates quoted in newspapers or other media aren't usually available to the public. These rates are typically wholesale rates available on amounts of $1 million USD or more, transferred electronically between banks.</div><br>
           </li>
           <li><a href="#">How often are rates updated?</a>

           <li><a href="#">How do these rates compare to other rates?</a>
             <div>We are very competitive. Our rates are generally more favorable than those found at hotels or airports.</div><br>

           <li><a href="#">What is the euro and where is it used?</a>
             <div><p>The euro is the official currency of the European Union (EU). Not all countries that are a part of the EU use the euro, however.</p>
            <p>Currently, euro is used in the following locations:</p>
               <ul>
               	<li>Andorra</li>
				<li>Austria</li>
				<li>Belgium</li>
				<li>Cyprus</li>
				<li>Estonia</li>
				<li>Finland</li>
				<li>France</li>
				<li>Germany</li>
				<li>Greece</li>
				<li>Ireland</li>
				<li>Italy</li>
				<li>Kosovo</li>

             <div>
             <p>No, those countries that use the euro stopped accepting their previous (or legacy) currencies at the time of their conversion to the euro as their official currency. You can exchange your legacy currency at central banks in countries that use the euro.</p>
             <p>For more information about the euro, go to http://www.euro.ecb.int</p>

         <h2>Security and Browser Requirements</h2>
         <ul class="faq">
           <li><a href="#">Is purchasing online secure? </a>
             <div><p>To help ensure security, the billing and personal information you provide us is encrypted through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encodes information transmitted over the Internet between your computer and Wells Fargo. This ensures that the information you provide to us is confidential.</p>
                  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> To help protect your personal information, you should end your browser session after you complete your order and before you leave your computer.</p>
                  <p>In addition to the above, Wells Fargo integrates several fraud prevention measures to maximize the security of your private online information. </p>
                  <p>These measures include but are not limited to:</p>

                 <ul>
                   <li><strong>Data Integrity -</strong> This involves ensuring that the same data is transmitted from the user's computer to Wells Fargo. Specifically, data integrity involves
                  preventing unauthorized creation, alteration, or destruction of data from unauthorized sources through the Internet.<br><br>
                  24 hours a day, 7 days a week, Wells Fargo utilizes sophisticated data integrity checks that control the risk of data alteration during transmission to identify any data that has been altered.</li>
                  <li><strong>Encryption -</strong>  Encryption is a way to control data integrity. Encryption makes it difficult for an unauthorized party to read transaction data.</li>
                  <li><strong>Internal System Controls -</strong> Internal System Controls are also implemented to ensure the integrity of data while it is being processed by Wells Fargo. </li>
                 </ul>
            </div><br>
           </li>
           <li><a href="#">What kind of hardware and software do I need to order online?</a>
             <div><p>We are continually upgrading our online services to provide you with the most valuable and secure online access. As we add new features and enhancements to our service, older browser versions or Internet devices like WebTV may not support these new standards. Upgrading to a new version will enhance your security.</p>

               <p>Wells Fargo's minimum encryption requirement for secure online access is 128-bit encrypted browsers. </p>
